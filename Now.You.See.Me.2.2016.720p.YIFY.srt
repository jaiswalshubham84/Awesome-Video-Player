RIPPED BY ELAJOHN 

2
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,716
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:34,508
Excuse me. Coming through.

4
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,341
<i>Tonight, so-called
magician Lionel Shrike</i>

5
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:40,841
<i>is making another sad
attempt for attention</i>

6
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:44,382
<i>by performing what he calls
an impossible feat.</i>

7
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:47,716
<i>The safe is made of
the strongest iron.</i>

8
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:50,882
<i>It can't be sawed
through or pried.</i>

9
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:55,382
<i>Yet, Lionel Shrike thinks
he's able to escape.</i>

10
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:57,342
Dad! Dad!

11
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,049
Hey, buddy.

12
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,924
You made it?

13
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:05,507
Now, see that seat there?

14
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:11,382
Is Lionel Shrike the kind of
magician who can pull this off?

15
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:14,382
<i>Or is he actually
in over his head?</i>

16
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:15,882
We'll see about that.

17
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:17,049
What's the matter?

18
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,424
I don't want you to go.

19
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:20,632
Dylan, come on.
We talked about this.

20
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,924
Remember?
This is what I do.

21
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:25,591
I got to prove all
those naysayers wrong.

22
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:28,507
Okay? Besides...

23
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:31,591
I always keep
something up my sleeve.

24
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,717
Now, got your watch
like your dad's?

25
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,382
Okay. How many seconds?

26
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:37,841
300.

27
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:39,508
300. Maybe a few less.

28
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,342
I love you so much.

29
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:49,882
Okay.
See you later, big man.

30
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:54,675
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,
- Lionel Shrike!</i>

31
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,299
Will he be able
to hold his breath?

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,925
<i>Will he be able to
somehow escape the safe?</i>

33
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,675
Three, two, one...

34
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,549
Two, three,

35
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,050
four, five, six, seven, eight...

36
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:22,049
296...

37
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,342
297, 298, 299, 300.

38
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:33,383
303, 304...

39
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:35,466
<i>It's five minutes now,</i>

40
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:41,507
<i>and we have not seen or heard
anything from Lionel Shrike yet.</i>

41
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:42,717
Move!

42
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:45,050
Dad!

43
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:48,883
Dad! Dad!

44
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:52,300
Let go of me!

45
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:54,342
Dad!

46
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,592
No! Dad!

47
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:00,508
Dad! Let go!

48
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,800
Find him!

49
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:24,300
<i>The Eye.</i>

50
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:26,882
<i>It may not lie...</i>

51
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:30,550
<i>But don't think for a moment
that it can't be lied to.</i>

52
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,049
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

53
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,049
<i>But is it truth?</i>

54
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,507
<i>People see the Horsemen
as noble Robin Hoods.</i>

55
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:41,674
<i>Are they?</i>

56
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:44,882
<i>Or are they common thieves?</i>

57
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:46,383
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

58
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:52,716
<i>They robbed a bank in Paris
from a stage in Las Vegas.</i>

59
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:54,424
<i>They fleeced
an insurance magnate</i>

60
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:55,966
<i>of hundreds of
millions of dollars</i>

61
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:58,716
<i>and disappeared from
a roof in New York.</i>

62
00:03:58,717 --> 00:04:02,924
<i>Always showering their
devoted fans with money.</i>

63
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,882
<i>Here's what you don't know.</i>

64
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:07,049
<i>They left one man behind.</i>

65
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,008
<i>Framed. Holding the bag.</i>

66
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:10,883
<i>Me.</i>

67
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,632
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

68
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:17,842
<i>When you emerge, and you will...</i>

69
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,924
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

70
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:24,382
<i>Because mark my words,</i>

71
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:27,382
<i>you will get
what's coming to you.</i>

72
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:29,758
<i>In ways you can't expect.</i>

73
00:04:30,758 --> 00:04:33,382
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

74
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:36,382
<i>Because one thing I believe in</i>

75
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:39,675
<i>is any eye for an eye.</i>

76
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,758
<i>Welcome, Daniel Atlas.</i>

77
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,050
Who am I speaking to?

78
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:04,592
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

79
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:07,716
<i>You've asked many questions.</i>

80
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:10,299
<i>And registered many complaints.</i>

81
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,382
<i>You can rest assured
that we've heard you.</i>

82
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:13,882
Have you? Because I don't...

83
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:15,382
<i>Trust?
No.</i>

84
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:18,049
<i>Your leader?
Your fellow Horsemen?</i>

85
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,716
I don't like that we've been
living in hiding for a year.

86
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,924
I don't like that every
message I get from Dylan is,

87
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:27,466
"Wait. Be patient.

88
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:28,716
"The Eye has a plan."

89
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:31,049
<i>Wait. Be patient.</i>

90
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,507
<i>The Eye has a plan.</i>

91
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:35,549
This is games and
it's not working for me.

92
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,049
<i>You feel it is you who should
be leading the Horsemen,</i>

93
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,550
<i>not Dylan.</i>

94
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:43,632
<i>If that is what you desire,</i>

95
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:46,007
<i>stay the course.</i>

96
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:48,049
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

97
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,966
<i>and remarkable mind
will not go unrecognized.</i>

98
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,716
<i>We have a new mission
for the Horsemen.</i>

99
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:57,842
<i>Dylan has a plan and will
gather you together soon.</i>

100
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,675
<i>Now leave!</i>

101
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,966
North Carolina,
Florida, Maryland, Maine.

102
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,549
We're talking the entire
eastern seaboard.

103
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,507
I need to see some results.

104
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,424
Hey. Sorry.

105
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:25,507
Just real quick. Can I have
you for a couple of minutes?

106
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:26,757
I'm right in the middle
of something, Dylan.

107
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:28,716
No, I know. It's okay.
Hey. Hey, everybody. Sorry.

108
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:30,924
Sorry about that.

109
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,341
Call the mayor.

110
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:34,717
Thanks a lot.
Twins? Good.

111
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,924
Is he coming?

112
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:39,049
Look, I wouldn't have brought
you out of that meeting

113
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,716
unless it was
something important.

114
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:43,049
It's about the Horsemen.

115
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,424
Something's happening here
and it's happening now.

116
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,049
Message boards.
Elite magic society.

117
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,674
There is chatter going on
about the Horsemen

118
00:07:51,675 --> 00:07:54,507
and something happening with Octa,
the giant software company.

119
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,007
I know what Octa is.

120
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,841
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but two months ago

121
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,341
we sent men to Philadelphia
because he knew...

122
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:00,424
And I said that I was wrong.

123
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:02,049
He knew that the Horsemen

124
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,050
were going to hit the
Euro-Atlantic Banking Summit.

125
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:04,341
I have proof.

126
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:05,716
Let him talk.
Thank you.

127
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,341
Communications.

128
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:11,382
Contact between who I think
might be Daniel Atlas

129
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:14,007
and who may be Merritt McKinney.

130
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:16,049
And what do you have?
Emails? Cell phones?

131
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,549
Any transcripts?

132
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,716
Pigeons.
What?

133
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:22,049
I'm sorry,
you mean stool pigeons?

134
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,799
No, I mean actual pigeon pigeons.
Like carrier pigeons.

135
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,382
Okay? Magicians work

136
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:27,842
with pigeons.
Doves.

137
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,466
Stay with me.

138
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,674
This pigeon, right here...

139
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:36,424
There's Daniel Atlas.
Same pigeon.

140
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:37,549
East Village.

141
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,299
Same pigeon, West Village.

142
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,966
42nd Street, pigeon.
65th Street.

143
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,924
All the way up to the
George Washington Bridge

144
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,466
on a sail boat with a guy

145
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,674
that looks just
like Merritt McKinney.

146
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:51,049
And what does this all mean?

147
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,382
I know what it means.

148
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:53,674
It means nothing.
It's bullshit.

149
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:55,507
Could you sing a new song? No.

150
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:57,549
How is it that two years
ago you were so close...

151
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,049
You think I went out of my way to
screw up my own investigation?

152
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,341
But you want everybody else to
think that you're an idiot.

153
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,382
Okay, stop.

154
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:09,466
Cowan, I know I'm new here,
but as far as I can tell,

155
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,758
people who don't even know
you, think you're an asshole.

156
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:16,757
You don't know me, but my
first year in the Academy,

157
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:18,049
you gave a talk.

158
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,882
The "long game" you called it.

159
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:22,674
You talked about
a moral compass.

160
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,883
About how you believed
in yours immutably.

161
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:29,049
And I thought to myself,
"That guy.

162
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,008
"One day,
I want to be that guy."

163
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:36,341
And now... A pigeon?

164
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,549
Technically, it was a few pigeons,
but I hear what you're saying.

165
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,049
Okay. So here's what
I'm going to do.

166
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,632
You want to take a vacation day?

167
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:46,591
But I'm not going to devote
resources to another snipe hunt.

168
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:49,757
I came to clean this mess up,
not add to it. I'm sorry.

169
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:50,882
Boss, thank you.

170
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,424
I promise you,
it won't be a snipe hunt.

171
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,799
We're gonna get those Horsemen.

172
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,924
She's great.

173
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:58,716
The problem is

174
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:00,341
when you're two people
at the same time,

175
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:01,757
one of them is bound
to trip the other.

176
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:03,424
And when that happens,

177
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:05,050
I will be there.

178
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:06,883
Duly noted.

179
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:29,882
Hi!
Who are you?

180
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:31,716
What are you doing in my...
It's actually a funny story.

181
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:33,424
How did you get into my apartment?
Whoa!

182
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,716
I think it's funny.
It's not like funny "ha ha."

183
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,882
Or you might not think
that it's funny "ha ha."

184
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:40,382
I think it's funny. I guess
it's all kind of relative.

185
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:42,382
I was actually...
No, that's not...

186
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:44,591
I made myself in the
neighborhood and now I'm here,

187
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:45,883
and maybe...

188
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:49,882
Okay.

189
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,716
Seriously, how did
you get in here?

190
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,716
Are you some kind of
crazed fan or something?

191
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:55,716
My God. No, no, no,
I recognize you.

192
00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:57,466
You did that B-grade

193
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:58,882
"geek magic" thing, didn't you?
You pulled a...

194
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:00,049
Pulled a hat out of the rabbit.

195
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,466
A hat out of the rabbit,
that's right.

196
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:02,632
I know that it didn't work.

197
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:03,757
No, it was actually
kind of disgusting.

198
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:08,716
Well, your drop was obvious
and your body shell is flimsy.

199
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:09,966
So if you wouldn't mind

200
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:12,300
crawling out from
under my couch and...

201
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,549
Ta-da! Now I'm sitting
over here. Crazy!

202
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,507
By the way, that rabbit thing?

203
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:22,341
That was eight years ago, okay?

204
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:23,966
I've gotten so much
better since then.

205
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,716
Have you?
Yeah.

206
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:26,966
Okay, come here. What
is it that you want?

207
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,674
I wanted to meet you.
Everybody, really.

208
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:30,507
I want to be a part
of the Eye, okay?

209
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:33,549
I said it. I do. And I want
to use my magic for good,

210
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,882
like you and Merritt
and Jack especially.

211
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:38,966
That's right.
I know that Jack is alive.

212
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,424
I know that he
faked his own death.

213
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:41,757
I am a huge fan
of faking deaths.

214
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,382
That was crazy!

215
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:44,882
What is this?
A trucker's hitch?

216
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:46,757
Yeah.
It's terrible.

217
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:48,882
Embarrassing.
Okay.

218
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:51,924
By the way, I am so sorry
that Henley left you.

219
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:53,841
- God!
- Sorry.

220
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:55,341
That's actually a little better.

221
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:56,507
You know what I heard?

222
00:11:56,508 --> 00:12:00,382
I heard that she got
tired of waiting around.

223
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,841
She lost faith and so
she asked for an out,

224
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:04,799
and the Eye gave it to her.

225
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,049
But who knows, right?

226
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,299
In matters of the heart,
so difficult to tell.

227
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,549
I mean, maybe she got
sick of you.

228
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,716
You ever think about that?

229
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:13,924
Maybe you just didn't tie
her up tight enough.!

230
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:15,507
Here's what's going to happen.

231
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:17,799
You're going to stay
here and stop talking,

232
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,424
and I'm going to
make a phone call,

233
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,758
and in about five minutes,
some people are going...

234
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:30,507
It's all in the wrist.

235
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:33,592
Let the momentum of the
card do the work for you.

236
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:36,717
This last one I call the Stall.

237
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,007
Not bad.

238
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:42,716
Now you want to see
a thing of beauty?

239
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:44,549
I do indeed.
Here you go.

240
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,800
And bingo bango bongo.

241
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,549
No, no, no, it's
good to be positive

242
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,049
despite making zero
progress in a year.

243
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,341
Yeah.

244
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:56,341
Whereas when it
comes to hypnotism,

245
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,674
the student has almost
become the master.

246
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:00,882
I like your confidence,

247
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:03,424
but you might say that
you have the better teacher.

248
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,549
Ooh!
Yeah.

249
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,049
Your teacher definitely
doesn't know what he's doing.

250
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,049
By the way, was this
your card yesterday?

251
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,382
In fact it was.

252
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:12,591
I thought so.

253
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,342
That's not bad.

254
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,716
If I can hypnotize Danny before
you hit him with a card,

255
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,049
I get top bunk for a week.

256
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,049
Okay, that's a deal.

257
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,716
Stare at the palm of your hand
and as your eyes change focus,

258
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:30,007
you will begin to notice...

259
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:34,382
It's not working.
Please don't become him.

260
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:35,966
I didn't know you guys
did party tricks

261
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,757
when there weren't floozies
around to impress.

262
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:40,049
I think we stopped
trying to impress floozies

263
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,424
in, like, 1937.

264
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:44,549
Okay, somebody broke into
my apartment, all right?

265
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,382
Some amateur who knew
everything about me,

266
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:47,674
everything about Henley leaving,

267
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:48,882
and everything about us.

268
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,007
That's her.

269
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:51,716
Hey!

270
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:52,841
Hi.

271
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:53,966
You met Lula.

272
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,632
I've met her.
What is she doing here?

273
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:58,550
I'm the new Horseman!

274
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,674
I'm the girl Horseman.

275
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,382
Whoo!

276
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:04,550
Yeah!

277
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,716
Nobody.
No excitement.

278
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:08,049
Jack? Anything?

279
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,049
Dylan, tell me
what's going on here.

280
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,799
Well, Lula's been on the underground
scene for the last decade,

281
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,549
and I think she
has some real talent,

282
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,632
and I'd like to try her on stage

283
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:20,799
to balance out the duo.
What?

284
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,757
No, are you serious, man?

285
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:24,382
After Henley left, you said I
could get back on stage again.

286
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:25,757
Not someone who just showed up.

287
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:29,924
And I really need you behind the scenes
with me for a little while longer.

288
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:32,341
Dylan, come on. I've been behind
the scenes my whole life.

289
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:34,842
Which is a crime, might I add.
Have you seen that man's face?

290
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,924
The addition of some
femininity to the group,

291
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:42,382
over and above
what Atlas provides...

292
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,716
I think the real issue
is we've been in this...

293
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,049
Yeah, the issue is that we have
been rehearsing for months

294
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,882
for something... We don't
even know what it is.

295
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:50,966
And you're going to
keep working until...

296
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:52,049
Until we work as
a single organism.

297
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,341
I know, I've heard you say that.

298
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:57,341
I think what you're referring
to is us, not you.

299
00:14:57,342 --> 00:14:59,632
Listen, I'm getting my orders
directly from the Eye.

300
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,299
Okay? And then
I give them to you.

301
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,716
Now, if you don't like that,
you're welcome to go.

302
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:04,007
No, I'm not going anywhere.
But I'm...

303
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,882
Guys, can I just weigh
in here really quickly?

304
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:08,549
Because I think I see
what's going on here.

305
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,466
You guys are this amazing,
tight-knit family unit.

306
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:13,799
I'm a new person... We are
anything but a family.

307
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,757
Okay, well, my mother

308
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:17,882
literally knifed my father
in the neck one time.

309
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,924
So you are actually a little
bit like my family unit.

310
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,382
Literally?
But, yeah.

311
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:23,382
It was an accident, I think.

312
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:26,507
Okay. So, does this mean we're
actually going to do something?

313
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,632
Yes.

314
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:33,049
You've all heard of Octa and
their playboy CEO, Owen Case.

315
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,716
His partner, Walter Mabry,
died about a year ago.

316
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,049
You wanna know what all
this has been leading to?

317
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,716
Octa's hosting the launch
of the next-gen cell phone.

318
00:15:40,717 --> 00:15:42,674
Once these phones
hit the streets,

319
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,591
they'll siphon their users'
information to the black market.

320
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:49,382
Meaning Octa's selling
privacy to up their profit.

321
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:52,382
So, the Eye has decided
to expose them for it.

322
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:54,550
Our mission
is to hijack the show.

323
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:57,382
Rehearsal's over, guys.

324
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:58,966
This is what we've
been waiting for.

325
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,550
Now it's time to get to work.

326
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,841
<i>Welcome, Octa insiders,</i>

327
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:14,924
<i>We're delighted that you've joined us
to participate in our special event.</i>

328
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:16,799
<i>Today marks the beginning</i>

329
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,966
<i>of a bright new journey
in social networking.</i>

330
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:20,716
<i>Our latest product, Octa 8...</i>

331
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,883
Keys, cell phones,
iPads, in the bin.

332
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:25,549
Thank you, sir.

333
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:30,049
Can't have you texting,
tweeting, recording, or eating.

334
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,800
Sorry, we will take very
good care of it for you.

335
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,632
By the way.

336
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,424
Security memo from Case himself.

337
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:40,882
Couple of surprise guests.
Just follow his lead, yeah?

338
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:42,882
We're all good. I'm heading
to the control room.

339
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:44,550
All right.
Thanks, Jack.

340
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:46,882
Atlas, go.

341
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:48,924
No, Dylan, I can't...

342
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,299
<i>What?
What's the problem?</i>

343
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,382
No, there's too many people...

344
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:53,716
Atlas, I got Owen landing now.

345
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:55,341
Okay, I'm going now.

346
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:56,925
Stop.

347
00:16:58,383 --> 00:16:59,757
Okay.
Thanks.

348
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:01,118
Pascal, we need you
in the kitchen.

349
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,716
Look, the speech is
about freedom, okay?

350
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:23,507
That's what we're trying
to sell here, is freedom.

351
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:24,924
Which part of that
do you not understand?

352
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:26,299
For goodness sake!
I know, I'm sorry.

353
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,716
Mr. Case.
John from legal.

354
00:17:27,717 --> 00:17:29,549
Just need your
signature for release.

355
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,299
Thank you so much.

356
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,820
Just get it done
and get it back to me.

357
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:41,507
- Hey there, buddy!
- Smile!

358
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:43,841
Who are you? What the hell?
Who am I?

359
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:45,757
It is picture day. Did Julie
not tell you it's picture day?

360
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:47,757
Picture day? What are you...
Company-wide policy.

361
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:49,882
Look, I got a job to do.
I have a job to do, too.

362
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:51,299
Hold on a second.
What is that?

363
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,591
I'm going to need
some backup here.

364
00:17:52,592 --> 00:17:53,550
Who are you calling?
Hey! That's my ID.

365
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:54,716
Security, my name is

366
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:56,341
Bo Walsh, thank you.
Hey, I'm Bo Walsh!

367
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,716
Not this guy.
He's not Bo Walsh.

368
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:58,799
Calm down, please.

369
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,424
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

370
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:01,924
This guy just came and
put a flashlight in my eyes.

371
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:04,341
I'm trying to do my job.
This guy, check his badge.

372
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:05,924
Who is this guy?
I'm Bo Walsh, not him.

373
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,966
It says here,
"Evans Mental Facility.

374
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,549
"Mark D. Stooge."
Hold on a second.

375
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,674
I've never seen
this before in my life.

376
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:13,341
Come on, Mr. Stooge. Hold on.
He's not Mr. Walsh!

377
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,049
Come on. Let's go.
What's going on here?

378
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,924
I'm Bo Walsh, not him!

379
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:21,382
God, you cannot trust anybody
in this city anymore, can you?

380
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,049
Get off me! Look, I want
to make a phone call.

381
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,007
I want to call my boss!
Hey, hey! What's going on?

382
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:27,049
I want to call my boss,
and this jackass...

383
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,007
Hey! Make your phone call.
That's your right, sir.

384
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,424
That's my right.

385
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,382
What the hell? You're crazy.
Let's go.

386
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:34,966
This isn't my...
Where's my phone?

387
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:36,841
Where's my phone?

388
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:38,716
Atlas, Stooge has left
the building.

389
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:42,508
The circuit board is ours.
I am leaving backstage.

390
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,507
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,
- Owen Case.</i>

391
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:50,050
All right. Lula, show these
guys what you're made of.

392
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:59,003
I can take over from here.
Clark says you're on break.

393
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,299
What break? Who's Clark?

394
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,882
"Who's Clark?"
That's funny.

395
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:05,382
Imagine if I told Roger
that, he'd freak out.

396
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:07,382
Don't do that!
What?

397
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:08,716
Who the hell is Roger?

398
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:10,382
Does Lisa know that
you don't know Roger?

399
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,049
I don't know who Lisa is.
Are you kidding again?

400
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,716
You don't know who Lisa is now?
No, I don't. Just get away.

401
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,924
That is a dangerous...
You're ruining the meat.

402
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:17,674
Don't make me
have to go to Brian!

403
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:19,299
I don't know who Brian is! Why
are you acting like this?

404
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,780
I'll go straight to him.
Give me that!

405
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:23,717
My God!

406
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:28,466
<i>What are you doing to me?</i>

407
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,550
- Help me!
- Help her. Go!

408
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:34,507
Have some water.

409
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,341
I feel from your face you're
freaked by the flow of blood,

410
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,882
which is fully fixable in a snap

411
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:42,549
by focusing and following
the flow of my words

412
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,882
as you're flowing and floating,

413
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,882
which is why you're
focusing on my commands.

414
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:49,424
You got this far in life

415
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:52,007
by listening to one voice,
the voice in your head.

416
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:53,967
This is that voice.

417
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:57,882
Look at the light.

418
00:19:57,883 --> 00:20:00,842
Listen to your own voice.

419
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,717
My God.

420
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,466
Wow. What is that?
Is that a miracle towel?

421
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:15,049
Thank you so much.
Do you know what?

422
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,674
You have taught me that I'm not
cut out for this kind of work.

423
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,424
I quit!

424
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:21,508
Get another towel.

425
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,591
Thank you, and goodbye.

426
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:26,633
God.

427
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:30,924
<i>Welcome everybody!</i>

428
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:33,925
<i>And now, the moment that
you've all been waiting for...</i>

429
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,049
Nice work, lady.
Thanks.

430
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,008
<i>Revolutionized music
with Octa 2.</i>

431
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:44,841
I'm actually nervous, and
I'm not even going onstage.

432
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:47,382
You know, I've heard
that if you're nervous,

433
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:50,341
it can be really helpful
to picture each other naked.

434
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:52,007
It's actually picture
the audience naked.

435
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:53,882
No, this is new.
This is a new science.

436
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:55,424
So, I don't know.

437
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:56,716
Do you want...
We should try it.

438
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,632
Not the right mood.

439
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,341
Guess that leaves
you and me, old buddy.

440
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,425
What? Picture each other...
No. No, thank you.

441
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:06,299
I mean, I admit, from the
neck up there are issues.

442
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,424
But from the neck down,
the David.

443

<i>Owen Case.</i>

Good morning,

00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:15,925
Good morning,
Octa-lites.

446
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:21,716
<i>Now, I've made the claim
that Octa 8 is pure magic.</i>

<i>Hello, New York!</i>

460
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,049
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,924
<i>Hey, it's great to be back.</i>

462
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:19,383
<i>And have you met
our newest Horseman, Lula?</i>

463
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,383
- Feels good, right?
- Feels pretty good.

464
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:26,467
Pretty good.

465
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:30,632
<i>Thank you, thank you.
Um, okay.</i>

466
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,424
<i>We want to talk to you
about your privacy.</i>

467
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:34,549
<i>What does your privacy
mean to you?</i>

468
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,049
<i>Because apparently to Owen Case,
it means absolutely nothing.</i>

469
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,882
<i>No, actually it means less
than absolutely nothing.</i>

470
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:41,716
<i>You see, he's mocked
your privacy.</i>

471
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:46,049
<i>Right, and we're not just talking about
the things that you already agreed to</i>

472
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,507
<i>when you signed,
probably without reading</i>

473
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:51,675
<i>the terms and conditions
of Octas 1 through 7.</i>

474
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:58,341
Dylan, the FBI is here.

475
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:00,591
All right.
Don't worry about it.

476
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:02,675
All right,
go to plan C-4.

477
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,757
Lock the doors.

478
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:07,507
Hey, boss, I'm glad you're here.

479
00:23:07,508 --> 00:23:09,466
Don't.

480
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,799
Guys, look. We got to move
around, get in through the back.

481
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,466
These Horsemen are tricky, okay?

482
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:16,674
They got backup plans
on top of backup plans.

483
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:18,799
Hey, sorry, don't mean to
gloat, but I told you so.

484
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,382
We got an anonymous
phone call an hour ago.

485
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:23,716
Confirms everything
I've been telling her.

486
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:25,007
What are you talking about?

487
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:28,882
You've been crying wolf so
we wouldn't send them here.

488
00:23:28,883 --> 00:23:30,382
Boss, please.

489
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:35,632
Please tell me that you haven't bought
into Cowan's crazy, paranoid fantasia.

490
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:41,007
<i>We had Owen agree to a few terms
and conditions of our own.</i>

491
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:44,050
<i>So, everything that he had
once considered private...</i>

492
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,757
<i>That he thinks
is really private...</i>

493
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:52,799
<i>Yeah, everything that he once
considered private is now...</i>

494
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,883
My.

495
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,966
<i>As the Horsemen like to say,</i>

496
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:02,966
<i>magic is about
controlling perception.</i>

497
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:07,049
<i>You see them as champions
of the truth, but are they?</i>

498
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,049
<i>Or is that just another
one of their illusions?</i>

499
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,716
- What's going on, Rhodes?
- This is crazy.

500
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,341
We got to get everyone
to the other entrance.

501
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:16,549
Let's go, to the back.
No. You stay here.

502
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,341
<i>So, since they clearly
love secrets...</i>

503
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:21,841
<i>Let's reveal some of theirs.</i>

504
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:23,674
Danny, everyone,
get off the stage.

505
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:25,716
<i>Abort.</i>

506
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:27,382
Jack, go with them.

507
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:31,799
<i>Do you recall the death
of Jack Wilder?</i>

508
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,758
<i>What if I told you he's not just
alive, but he's actually right here.</i>

509
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:45,674
<i>And do you know
who else is here?</i>

510
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:47,299
<i>The FBI.</i>

511
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,508
<i>Let's let them in, shall we?</i>

512
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:52,591
<i>And now, for the big reveal.</i>

513
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:55,466
Go! Move!
To the stage.

514
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:57,507
<i>There's a fifth Horseman,</i>

515
00:24:57,508 --> 00:25:00,424
<i>and he's the biggest
criminal of them all.</i>

516
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:02,967
<i>FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes.</i>

517
00:25:04,592 --> 00:25:06,383
- I knew it.
- What?

518
00:25:07,717 --> 00:25:09,507
This is so much deeper
than you know, boss.

519
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,674
You think you're
looking at one thing,

520
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,382
but you have no idea.
Who are you?

521
00:25:12,383 --> 00:25:13,882
The same man I've always been.

522
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:15,967
Boys, I'm sorry.

523
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:26,424
You gotta be kidding me.

524
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:30,049
- Move! Move!
- Who are those guys?

525
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,466
Who cares? Come on!

526
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:32,716
- Hurry, hurry!
- Keep going!

527
00:25:32,717 --> 00:25:34,382
How the hell could this happen?

528
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:35,591
I thought Dylan had
everything under control.

529
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:37,424
Yeah.
Apparently he didn't.

530
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:38,882
Maybe you're the leak, Dan.

531
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:40,549
Where you been sneaking off to?

532
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,007
Don't you dare for a second
insinuate that I had...

533
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,591
I'm not insinuating.
That's your...

534
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,549
Let's get to the truck, come on!

535
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,049
- Stay together!
- Move! Move!

536
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,882
Lula, come on!

537
00:25:48,883 --> 00:25:50,842
Coming! Whoa!

538
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:54,883
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

539
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:03,050
<i>Sleep. Sleep.
Sleep. Sleep.</i>

540
00:26:13,592 --> 00:26:15,049
What the hell is going on?

541
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,382
Wasn't there supposed
to be a truck?

542
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:17,550
Where the hell are we?

543
00:26:19,717 --> 00:26:20,924
Come on!

544
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:22,882
Hey, hey! Wait,
did you mis-run the tube?

545
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:24,716
No, I put it in the truck.
I know I did!

546
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,382
Because we're really
not in the truck right now.

547
00:26:26,383 --> 00:26:30,717
I'm moving! Relax! There's
something very wrong.

548
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,507
Okay.
Why are we here?

549
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:38,549
Why am I frickin' starving?

550
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,716
Yeah, I'm weirdly starving, too.

551
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:43,008
This makes no sense.

552
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,383
Okay, sorry.

553
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,424
At least, and I know this
isn't much consolation,

554
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:14,757
but apparently we're now
surrounded by Chinese food.

555
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,924
Right?

556
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:20,507
I think where we are right now, they
don't refer to it as "Chinese food."

557
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:21,758
It's just called

558
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,633
"food."

559
00:27:27,717 --> 00:27:30,550
Wait, what are you saying?
How is this possible?

560
00:27:32,842 --> 00:27:37,007
I believe in your particular
parlance, the word is

561
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:38,382
"magic."

562
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:40,924
That guy looks exactly like you.

563
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,007
He looks exactly like you. Are
you seeing this right now?

564
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:45,341
Chase.

565
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:49,424
It's like what I heard about
meeting the Rolling Stones.

566
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:51,382
They're a lot shorter in person.

567
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:54,341
Remember I told you about the guy
who screwed me out of everything?

568
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:57,674
This is my twin brother, Chase.

569
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,425
Wait, did you do this?

570
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:03,632
As you can see,

571
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,549
my boss don't mess around.

572
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,382
I do not understand what is
going on right now. At all.

573
00:28:08,383 --> 00:28:10,507
Okay, let me break it
down for you.

574
00:28:10,508 --> 00:28:14,549
You jumped off a rooftop in New
York and you landed in Macau.

575
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:18,674
AKA the Vegas of China.

576
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:20,549
And presto-changeo.

577
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,757
Don't you just love it?

578
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:23,882
The "greatest magicians
in the world"

579
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:26,549
are the object of someone
else's magic trick?

580
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,717
Isn't that poetic?

581
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,382
No?
You know what,

582
00:28:32,383 --> 00:28:34,466
I'm not gonna let you
guys yuck my yum.

583
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:36,883
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu.
Whatever.

584
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,424
And you know what they say,

585
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:42,966
"What happens in Macau..."

586
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,591
Well, I don't know
the rest of it,

587
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:46,424
'cause it's in Chinese...

588
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,050
Hey, thanks, guys!

589
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,966
<i>Reports are coming in

591

<i>As we learned of the miraculous

Hey, seriously,
where are you guys?

598
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:35,382
I'm at the meetup. I've
been leaving you messages.

599
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:36,466
I haven't heard from anyone.

600
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:38,382
Please, call me!

<i>Big gains and modest

Hey, tell me you're safe.
Where are you?

603
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:48,007
<i>- Right where you left me.
- 18 months ago,</i>

604
00:29:48,008 --> 00:29:49,716
Agent Rhodes.

605
00:29:49,717 --> 00:29:50,966
Thaddeus?

606
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:52,924
<i>How does it feel
to lose everything?</i>

607
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:56,882
Your job. Your identity.
Your reason for living.

608
00:29:56,883 --> 00:30:00,300
How does it feel to be out of
control, perhaps for the first time?

609
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:05,883
You're a fool, Agent Rhodes.
You always have been.

610
00:30:07,717 --> 00:30:08,757
Where are they?

611
00:30:08,758 --> 00:30:09,882
I'm not telling
you on the phone!

612
00:30:09,883 --> 00:30:15,049
And if you're wondering if I was
behind the Horsemen's recent debacle,

613
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,882
I'll let you work
that out for yourself.

614
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:18,716
Hey, I burned you once,
I'll burn you again.

615
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:19,966
I'm not playing, Thaddeus.

616
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:22,799
It's not my game,
Agent Rhodes. It's yours.

617
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,424
You started it when

<i>This is simply my move.</i>

<i>No!</i>

00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,882
Blind spots.

628
00:31:09,883 --> 00:31:11,716
We learned that together.
Didn't we, bro?

629
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:15,049
Did he tell you that
we were partners once?

630
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,466
No? I didn't think so.
The "Mini-McKinneys."

631
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:20,841
<i>♪ Chasey and a Mer-Bear</i>

632
00:31:20,842 --> 00:31:22,882
<i>♪ Gonna make you scare-bear</i>

633
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:26,424
<i>♪ Ma-ma-magic McKinneys</i>

634
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:28,507
Cool.

635
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:32,757
And then, one day, we were 12

636
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,049
and Virginia von Welsheim

637
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,382
had a very nice party
down the street.

638
00:31:38,383 --> 00:31:41,049
I had a little tum-tum,
couldn't go.

639
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:45,717
Mer-Bear did it on his own, and
got a taste of the solo thing,

640
00:31:47,883 --> 00:31:49,341
and kicked me to the curb.

641
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:50,716
God.

642
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:53,716
Chase, you win!
I concede.

643
00:31:53,717 --> 00:32:00,883
Delivery guy came to your door
about a month ago, little za.

644
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:02,674
Za?

645
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:05,716
Pizza?

646
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,549
Is this apartment d3375?

647
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,633
Not even close.

648
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,342
Sleep!

649
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:17,049
Relaxing, floating,

650
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,382
drifting, dreaming...

651
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:21,716
Falling.

652
00:32:21,717 --> 00:32:24,007
So, what he did,
my little womb-mate,

653
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:28,007
is he downloaded all
your private information,

654
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:31,424
and my employer
had all he needed.

655
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:32,757
Thanks.

656
00:32:32,758 --> 00:32:35,716
How did you know
how to find him?

657
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:38,883
That's a very good question, Atlas.
Okay.

658
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:59,883
Just follow the guards.
They'll take you to my boss.

659
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:07,007
Been fun playing this
cat-and-mouse with you, broski.

660
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:08,967
Meow.

661
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:13,467
Have fun at the Sands.

662
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:18,841
I am so, so, so sorry.

663
00:33:18,842 --> 00:33:23,008
Don't ever accuse me of
betraying us again, okay?

664
00:33:35,425 --> 00:33:38,299
Do you guys ever think that
the Eye is watching this?

665
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,717
You know, that maybe this
is even what they want?

666
00:33:42,717 --> 00:33:44,507
And at the exact right moment,

667
00:33:44,508 --> 00:33:46,716
they're gonna swoop in,
and we'll be like,

668
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:48,716
"Yes! Thank God
you're here!

669
00:33:48,717 --> 00:33:51,299
"Thank God! Just in
the nick of time, Eye!"

670
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,966
And then we'll just celebrate,

671
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:55,383
and it was all
worth it in the end?

672
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:01,549
I don't even really
think that, either, so...

673
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,550
It's cool.

674
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,883
Ta-da!

675
00:34:22,508 --> 00:34:24,632
So happy to be working with you.

676
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:26,382
Please, come in. Come in.

677
00:34:26,383 --> 00:34:28,549
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

678
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,549
Wait, sorry, how are you
working with us?

679
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,882
Well, as much as a magician
who pulls a rabbit from a hat

680
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:35,841
is working with that rabbit.

681
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:38,341
We'll be working
together. Yes.

682
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:42,424
Yeah, you're Walter Mabry.
You died a year ago.

683
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:44,007
Yes. An idea I got
from you, Mr. Wilder.

684
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:46,007
Fake your death, the world
puts its guard down.

685
00:34:46,008 --> 00:34:48,049
I'm able to control
quite a few companies,

686
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,382
including my old partner,
Owen's,

687
00:34:50,383 --> 00:34:52,882
as a consortium of so-called
anonymous shareholders.

688
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,424
And that violates
how many SEC laws?

689
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:56,716
I believe it breaks all of them.

690
00:34:56,717 --> 00:34:58,299
All of them.

691
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,007
You see,
you all want an audience.

692
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:03,299
Need one, desperately.

693
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,591
It's quite sad, really.

694
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,716
Hence, my ability to nab you.

695
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:09,674
I, on the other hand,
want the opposite of that.

696
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:12,299
I just want to be, and I am

697
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,007
100% off the grid.

698
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:15,549
You know why?

699
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,966
Yeah, because the grid
is for actual human beings.

700
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,549
No, because in a world
of total surveillance,

701
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,716
the only true freedom
lies in not being seen.

702
00:35:23,717 --> 00:35:25,966
You can't control the grid
from within the grid.

703
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:27,966
Follow me.
Yeah.

704
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:29,841
Follow me.
Okay. All right.

705
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:32,341
You pulled a hat out of a rabbit.
That was very colorful.

706
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:34,007
Almost eight and
a half years ago.

707
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,841
So, no need to bring that up.

708
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,549
We can't all be held accountable
for our adolescent personas.

709
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,716
Can we, Magicolio?

710
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:43,299
Magicolio,
that was 15 years ago.

711
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,716
Like you, and many others who, I suppose,
were not getting any sex in high school,

712
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:50,632
I dabbled with it.

713
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:52,799
But, unlike you, I was
able to transition upward

714
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,924
towards actual magic.

715
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:56,633
Science, you may
have heard it called.

716
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:03,966
Would you like to know, my
friends, just how I got you here?

717
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:05,382
We know how you did it.

718
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:07,424
No, you don't.
Yeah,

719
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:09,382
you stole our files for the show,
then obviously hypnotized us.

720
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:13,341
The strobe was a combo of
binaural beats, as well as...

721
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:15,674
I said stop!

722
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:19,424
You might not be
having fun, but I am.

723
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:21,508
You have an unusual
way of showing it.

724
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:23,050
So...

725
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,883
How did I do it?

726
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:30,049
You see, magicians like to control
other people's perceptions.

727
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,716
In your heightened
state of agitation,

728
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:34,049
<i>you saw the simplest cues.
Black tube, roof.</i>

729
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,674
<i>And your minds
filled in the rest.</i>

730
00:36:36,675 --> 00:36:39,549
<i>But the tube you meant to go
down was 20 feet to your right.</i>

731
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,674
Go on, sit down. There's no
one standing in your way.

732
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:42,800
Don't mind if I do.

733
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:47,299
Anyway, once in the tube,
yes, you're right...

734
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,299
<i>Blah, blah, blah,
the strobe contained</i>

735
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,049
<i>UV letters pulsing
the word "sleep."</i>

736
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:56,966
<i>And that, combined with the sound, put
you into an instant alpha pattern.</i>

737
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,841
<i>Sleep, sleep, sleep.</i>

738
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,591
And from then on,
it really was just fun.

739
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:02,841
And I can assure you,

740
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:04,967
you don't know what happened.

741
00:37:09,717 --> 00:37:10,841
That's really creepy.

742
00:37:10,842 --> 00:37:12,717
Really, really creepy.

743
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:16,799
That's not cool.

744
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,508
Yep, easy stuff, magic,

745
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:21,299
if you put your mind to it.

746
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,341
All right, that's enough.
So why are we here, then?

747
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,966
Besides you getting to show off
how adorably clever you are.

748
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:28,882
Well, to start with, the man
you stole from last year,

749
00:37:28,883 --> 00:37:30,341
turns out I had invested

750
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:31,716
quite a lot of money
in some of his companies,

751
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:34,966
so a lot of what you
stole was, in fact, mine.

752
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:37,841
Good news is, it's very easy
for you to pay me back.

753
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:40,716
I just need your skills.

754
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,591
Owen and I were like the Beatles,
if the Beatles had been...

755
00:37:43,592 --> 00:37:44,716
Elfin?

756
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:46,049
Geniuses.

757
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,841
Pretty sure the Beatles
were geniuses.

758
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:49,383
And like them, we had a dream.

759
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:54,799
Could we create actual,
genuine magic?

760
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,299
And I'm guessing one of you achieved
that dream, and it wasn't you?

761
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,466
That is what he
would like you to think.

762
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:06,674
Was a perfect blend
of elegance and technology.

763
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:08,966
But Owen wanted it for
himself so he humiliated me

764
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:12,382
by exposing my private files
to the board of directors

765
00:38:12,383 --> 00:38:13,799
and convinced them
that I am unstable.

766
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,966
Did you take a picture of
him while he was sleeping?

767
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:17,549
He had me kicked out of
my own company,

768
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,716
taking credit for a chip that's
not just the key to one computer,

769
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:24,841
but every computer
system on the planet.

770
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:27,966
It can un-encrypt anything,
crack the defense firewall,

771
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:30,841
manipulate markets,
and spy on anyone.

772
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,716
And now it's being sold
to the highest bidder.

773
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:34,424
If you're so rich,
why don't you just buy it?

774
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:35,841
So he gets the money?

775
00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:38,049
And the pleasure? No.

776
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,549
Why would I buy it when I could
have you steal it for me?

777
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,382
It's being previewed tomorrow
to the various suitors,

778
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:46,882
which will include your targets,

779
00:38:46,883 --> 00:38:48,549
a crew lead by
a South African gangster.

780
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,799
Yes. How your team gets past
security, that's up to you.

781
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,799
But once you do, you just need
to inspect it and steal it.

782
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,924
Come on, this is
perfect for you, isn't it?

783
00:38:57,925 --> 00:38:59,716
You're magicians and thieves.

784
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:01,882
What makes you think we would
even consider doing this?

785
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:05,382
Um, wait, I had a reason.
What was it? Yes.

786
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:06,924
You see, back home,
you're wanted criminals.

787
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:10,382
But here, I control the police,
the casinos, the media.

788
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:13,633
I can give you a new life,
out of hiding.

789
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,008
And if you don't,
I'll have you killed.

790
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:20,049
You know what?

791
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,716
I'm not stealing
a thing for you.

792
00:39:21,717 --> 00:39:23,549
Not unless Dylan
tells me it's okay.

793
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,716
Really? Dylan is where, exactly?

794
00:39:25,717 --> 00:39:28,882
Yeah, I'm with him. So you
can go ahead and kill us

795
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:30,924
because I'm not gonna steal
anything for you either.

796
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:34,674
Strikes me that a consensus
seems to be forming, Walter,

797
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:36,383
and we're calling your bluff.

798
00:39:37,883 --> 00:39:39,966
Actually, we'll do it. What?

799
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:42,841
We're in Macau. The oldest magic
store in the world is here.

800
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:46,383
We'll get the supplies we
need, and we'll do it.

801
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,799
Thank you.

802
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,508
Chase will take you to the
magic shop in the morning.

803
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,592
<i>Badge.</i>

804
00:40:03,342 --> 00:40:04,550
Really?

805
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,924
Thanks.

806
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:09,008
Agent Cowan.

807
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,549
Your ID.

808
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,967
Yeah. Thanks.

809
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:20,591
It appears Mr. Bradley's
still at dinner.

810
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:23,425
Yeah? Tell him
recess is over.

811
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,342
What?

812
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:54,007
Where are they? I don't
have time for bullshit.

813
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:56,674
I have all the time
in the world, thanks to you.

814
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:58,424
And I didn't get to
finish my lobster,

815
00:40:58,425 --> 00:40:59,924
which makes me very grumpy.

816
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:02,882
Okay, let's cut the crap.
What do you want?

817
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:06,299
You can dispense with the
tough guy act to begin with.

818
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,758
You're too desperate
for it to be believable.

819
00:41:10,842 --> 00:41:13,549
I said, what do you want?

820
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,882
You used a form 219 warrant

821
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:19,882
You found a connection between
me and the Four Horsemen.

822
00:41:19,883 --> 00:41:22,007
Which means

823
00:41:22,008 --> 00:41:24,591
you can take me out of
here on a 24-hour leave.

824
00:41:24,592 --> 00:41:25,883
You want me to break you out?

825
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:29,591
I want you to take me out.

826
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:31,882
All you need is
an extradition order,

827
00:41:31,883 --> 00:41:33,842
which you'll find in
that tray by my printer.

828
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:41,007
I had nothing to do with the
Horsemen's disappearance.

829
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:43,716
You were lured into a trap.

830
00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:46,757
And like Dorothy did
when she landed in Oz,

831
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:48,966
you're beginning to realize

832
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,632
that the only way out

833
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:53,007
is through.

834
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:55,633
And I'm the only one
who can get you there.

835
00:41:56,967 --> 00:41:58,424
You got this place wired.

836
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:00,591
You don't need me
to get out of here.

837
00:42:00,592 --> 00:42:02,632
This is all about payback.

838
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:04,966
I believe in an eye for an eye.

839
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:06,549
So you're out to destroy me?

840
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,049
You think I'm still gonna
play your little game?

841
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,841
I know you will.

842
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:12,882
Because no matter
how hard you try

843
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:14,882
to find a culprit
behind all this,

844
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,466
you're going to blame
only yourself.

845
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:22,049
When your little vendetta ended with
you putting me in jail 18 months ago,

846
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,882
you got tired, you got sloppy.
You stopped paying attention.

847
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:27,967
And that's where you lost.

848
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,716
So,

849
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,717
you can save yourself,

850
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:38,716
or you can make a deal with me,

851
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:40,882
and save the Four Horsemen,

852
00:42:40,883 --> 00:42:44,342
and stop wasting
both of our time.

853
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:48,882
<i>Steal something</i>

854
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:51,841
for this narcissistic little man boy?
I don't like it.

855
00:42:51,842 --> 00:42:53,799
But what I like less
is you deciding for us.

856
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,716
Yeah? Do you like that we're the
laughing stocks of the magic world,

857
00:42:56,717 --> 00:42:58,591
and the fugitives
of the actual world?

858
00:42:58,592 --> 00:43:00,424
Walter is right.
We have nowhere to go.

859
00:43:00,425 --> 00:43:01,716
But we can fix that.

860
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:02,966
We can fix it?
Yeah.

861
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:04,591
So you're officially
part of the team now?

862
00:43:04,592 --> 00:43:06,507
Excuse me? I'm sure
this is what Dylan

863
00:43:06,508 --> 00:43:08,632
meant when he said we should
all work as a single organism.

864
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:11,882
Yeah, that is a fairytale that
Dylan tells himself, and tells us.

865
00:43:11,883 --> 00:43:14,716
Look, even if we get this
stick, he'll never let us go.

866
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,049
We can't trust Walter, okay?

867
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,841
The Eye has a history in Macau.

868
00:43:18,842 --> 00:43:19,882
They're the only
ones we can trust.

869
00:43:19,883 --> 00:43:21,841
Now, if we can get it to them,

870
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:23,299
they can clear our names and
get us the hell out of here.

871
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,800
It's a bad plan, man.

872
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:33,967
Hey.

873
00:43:34,883 --> 00:43:36,342
Hi, how are you?

874
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:38,424
Um, we need some
things custom-made.

875
00:43:38,425 --> 00:43:39,966
Actually, by tomorrow.
We're kind of in a rush.

876
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:41,716
And...

877
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:43,597
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

878
00:43:49,883 --> 00:43:53,341
Welcome to long's.
My name's Li. Not Bruce Lee.

879
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:54,591
What?
Got you.

880
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:55,717
Okay.
Look.

881
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,007
And now it's
by my head. How fun.

882
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:04,716
$20.
$20?

883
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:06,716
No, thank you.
We're kind of in a rush.

884
00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:08,966
$10.
No.

885
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:11,966
Okay, all right. Just
give us the thumbs. Yeah?

886
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:14,424
Okay. Thanks a lot,
Jack. Please take these.

887
00:44:14,425 --> 00:44:17,049
So, we need a Keplinger holdout,

888
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:20,424
and we also need roughing
fluid, a Sanada gimmick,

889
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:23,300
sleeves, tracks. This is all in
plastic, though, if you can.

890
00:44:27,717 --> 00:44:28,758
What?

891
00:44:30,883 --> 00:44:35,716
My grandmother wants to know why plastic?
Plastic is cheap.

892
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:38,049
Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic
because we're...

893
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,716
We're going through a very
sensitive metal detector, okay?

894
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:44,633
So plastic, nothing.
Metal...

895
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:47,883
It detects.

896
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,007
What did she say?

897
00:44:55,008 --> 00:44:57,716
She said just because you're talking
slowly and moving your hands

898
00:44:57,717 --> 00:44:59,716
doesn't mean she can
suddenly understand English.

899
00:44:59,717 --> 00:45:00,799
Yeah.

900
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,591
So sorry. He's racist.

901
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:06,841
Listen, I know that the
only thing that we agree on

902
00:45:06,842 --> 00:45:10,716
is that our mom and dad
had one too many children.

903
00:45:10,717 --> 00:45:13,882
So why don't we just let
the kids play with their toys

904
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:15,507
and go get
a little drinkey-poo?

905
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:16,966
If it's free, it's me.

906
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,424
Great.

907
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:20,841
Guys, we'll be right back.

908
00:45:20,842 --> 00:45:24,632
Okay, kiddies, the
chaperones are watching you.

909
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:26,883
Don't do anything
I wouldn't enjoy.

910
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:30,008
Okay.
Have fun, you two.

911
00:45:32,425 --> 00:45:33,882
Hey.

912
00:45:33,883 --> 00:45:35,841
Can I use your phone?
It's kind of important.

913
00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:38,007
Sure.

914
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:39,758
On the house.
Thanks.

915
00:45:41,425 --> 00:45:44,007
I'm arranging
to hand over the stick.

916
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:45,882
So that's how we've been
contacting the Eye?

917
00:45:45,883 --> 00:45:47,341
You've been doing it
on your own?

918
00:45:47,342 --> 00:45:48,507
Maybe.

919
00:45:48,508 --> 00:45:50,882
God. Dylan's not
gonna like this.

920
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:52,507
I'm not really concerned
with what Dylan likes.

921
00:45:52,508 --> 00:45:54,467
Okay?
I'm doing this for us.

922
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,966
What is wrong with this thing?

923
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:00,341
Hey, relax,
it's just a kid's toy.

924
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:01,675
Yeah, that's what I thought.

925
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,007
Okay. Let me just...

926
00:46:03,008 --> 00:46:05,633
Sorry, sorry. Jesus.

927
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,967
Hey, can you get this?

928
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,591
It's like birth, you know.

929
00:46:16,592 --> 00:46:18,799
One person enters the hospital,

930
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,049
two people come out.

931
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,674
Walk and talk.

932
00:46:21,675 --> 00:46:23,966
I'll tell you on the plane.

933
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:26,299
What plane?

934
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,342
My sources tell me your
Horsemen are in Macau.

935
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:31,049
What's the look?

936
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,382
It's none of your business.

937
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:33,633
Who are your sources?

938
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,383
Just some old friends.

939
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,299
When we have the card,
where do I go?

940
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,675
And 0 for 52.

941
00:46:50,717 --> 00:46:53,758
Well, it's perfect.
It's a perfect score.

942
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,674
Then what about girls?

943
00:46:57,675 --> 00:46:59,549
Like, relationships?

944
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,758
What?

945
00:47:04,592 --> 00:47:08,299
Look, it's not
something I'm proud of,

946
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,882
but every girl I get close to,

947
00:47:11,883 --> 00:47:14,382
I end up taking their trust.

948
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:16,883
And then their wallet.

949
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:18,633
So...

950
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:22,549
You take their wallets?

951
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,633
Yeah.

952
00:47:25,758 --> 00:47:27,925
You ever take their belts?

953
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:30,591
Or how about

954
00:47:30,592 --> 00:47:33,841
some peanuts from the hotel bar?

955
00:47:33,842 --> 00:47:36,841
Not sure why you took those.

956
00:47:36,842 --> 00:47:40,008
I'm sorry, did you think that
I was like those other girls?

957
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,467
Jack.

958
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:51,382
Okay. So there's a
marketplace down the street.

959
00:47:51,383 --> 00:47:53,549
And I'm meeting
a man with a blue hat.

960
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,382
He'll get the stick to the
right people and get us home.

961
00:47:56,383 --> 00:47:58,424
You go grab Merritt, okay?
We got a lot to do.

962
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:00,299
And, hey, put your belt on.

963
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,007
No, it's not...
She took it off me and...

964
00:48:04,008 --> 00:48:06,966
You know, the most heartbreaking
moment of my life

965
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,299
was when I discovered

966
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,799
that you had stolen
all my money and split.

967
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,966
I didn't realize until now

968
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:16,549
how much of that money
you put into your face.

969
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:21,299
Seriously, is it weird to have more
hair in your nose than on your head?

970
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,841
Speaking of, next time
you get a hair transplant,

971
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:26,632
you might wanna
consider requesting

972
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:29,549
something other
than old man pubes.

973
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:33,674
You know what? You are
such a buffoon, Mer-Bear.

974
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:35,674
And this little ploy you have

975
00:48:35,675 --> 00:48:39,841
of stalling me while your
friends screw over my employer?

976
00:48:39,842 --> 00:48:41,550
Not gonna work.

977
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,674
Chase! As you stare
into my eyes,

978
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:48,049
you will find
that you wanna sleep.

979
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,591
When you wake, you will beg
for Merritt's forgiveness

980
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:54,050
and realize that you will never
be half the man that he is.

981
00:48:56,008 --> 00:48:57,299
Merritt,

982
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,716
I am so, so very, very sorry

983
00:49:02,717 --> 00:49:05,549
about how pathetic
your pupil is.

984
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,799
Hey, a little hint on your
technique of surprise.

985
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,592
It lacks that all-essential
little element of surprise.

986
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:15,924
Hey, this has been fun,
Mer-Bear.

987
00:49:15,925 --> 00:49:18,008
Let's do it again sometime.

988
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:22,966
Well,

989
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:26,508
I've had ample time to do
some research, and you know,

990
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:31,341
I think the Eye
might actually be real.

991
00:49:31,342 --> 00:49:32,799
Thought you didn't
buy into all that.

992
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,841
I'd be lying if I
said I didn't think

993
00:49:34,842 --> 00:49:38,382
that this road would lead to the
great wizard behind the curtain

994
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:40,882
and, in the end,
I might get to see his face.

995
00:49:40,883 --> 00:49:43,841
Even if the fate of
the Horsemen depends on it?

996
00:49:43,842 --> 00:49:45,341
Listen to me.
I broke you out of there.

997
00:49:45,342 --> 00:49:46,591
We're not
changing the terms now.

998
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:47,841
You put me there!
Yeah,

999
00:49:47,842 --> 00:49:49,424
because you deserve to be there.

1000
00:49:49,425 --> 00:49:52,049
Listen, I did not
kill your father.

1001
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,966
All right, all right,
let's just cut the bullshit.

1002
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,424
I know who you are,

1003
00:49:58,425 --> 00:49:59,675
Shrike.

1004
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:02,966
I know you blame me
for your father's death.

1005
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:07,007
I know you think I goaded him into
performing a trick he couldn't pull off.

1006
00:50:07,008 --> 00:50:09,424
I know the time in
jail was a result

1007
00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:11,591
of a 30-year revenge plot
against me.

1008
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,299
Supposing that's all true,
you think I'd tell you now?

1009
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,508
Man.

1010
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,425
30 years.

1011
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:24,591
And the greatest long game
magic trick ever created.

1012
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:26,966
Just to put me behind bars.

1013
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:28,342
Okay.

1014
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:31,883
So how did it feel,
seeing me there?

1015
00:50:32,842 --> 00:50:34,675
Was it all you hoped?

1016
00:50:34,717 --> 00:50:35,882
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1017
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:37,050
You're lying.

1018
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,424
It was an empty experience.

1019
00:50:40,425 --> 00:50:42,508
And you wanna know how I know?

1020
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,425
I know because you know.

1021
00:50:47,592 --> 00:50:50,841
There's always, always more

1022
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:52,674
than what's on the surface.
So what,

1023
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,299
the past didn't happen, and
you're not who I think you are?

1024
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,882
Now, don't tell me in 30 years

1025
00:50:55,883 --> 00:50:58,758
that's the first time you've
asked yourself that question.

1026
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:00,924
I am not my father.

1027
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,757
You're not getting
in my head, okay?

1028
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:05,424
You think you're luring me into a trap?
You're not.

1029
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:08,007
Now, I am desperate,
which means I'm dangerous.

1030
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:11,632
My only concern is the health
and well-being of the Horsemen.

1031
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:14,424
And you're gonna lead me to them.
And if you don't,

1032
00:51:14,425 --> 00:51:16,424
I promise you, you're
gonna end up far worse

1033
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:19,008
than in some cushy
jail cell somewhere.

1034
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:36,050
What if the Horsemen don't
actually need you to save them?

1035
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:43,341
All right. So the lab is made
up of two distinct layers,

1036
00:51:43,342 --> 00:51:44,632
the security perimeter

1037
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:46,632
and the clean room.

1038
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:48,675
The stick we're looking for
should be in this core.

1039
00:51:48,717 --> 00:51:50,716
So we're gonna have to
get underneath, extract it,

1040
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:52,632
and replace it with a decoy.

1041
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:58,591
Luckily, it's similar in weight
and size to a playing card,

1042
00:51:58,592 --> 00:52:00,552
so we're gonna have to
brush up on our card-istry.

1043
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:03,675
Whoa, whoa!

1044
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:09,342
That's no good.

1045
00:52:18,717 --> 00:52:20,966
So how do we get in?
Hannes Pike.

1046
00:52:20,967 --> 00:52:22,841
He's the son of
a South African gangster.

1047
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:24,799
<i>He's RSVP'd with what looks like</i>

1048
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,675
<i>a couple of members
of his security detail.</i>

1049
00:52:26,717 --> 00:52:29,716
<i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,
and somebody named Buffy.</i>

1050
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:33,507
<i>Yeah, apparently, he travels with
a different bimbo every week.</i>

1051
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:35,550
I wonder which one of us
gets to play the bimbo.

1052
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:46,675
Hey, can I get in?

1053
00:52:48,425 --> 00:52:49,924
At the soothing
sound of the slots

1054
00:52:49,925 --> 00:52:53,508
you slip into a serene state
of slumber and sleep.

1055
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:59,299
<i>They will think you're Hannes, so
lead them out and keep them busy.</i>

1056
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,507
You trust your
people implicitly.

1057
00:53:01,508 --> 00:53:03,549
You will have them
take care of everything,

1058
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,966
and you will wait in the car.

1059
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:08,675
And eyes open,
wide awake. Go.

1060
00:53:08,717 --> 00:53:10,591
Excuse me. These people
are following me.

1061
00:53:10,592 --> 00:53:11,992
You might wanna
check their pockets.

1062
00:53:15,842 --> 00:53:17,632
<i>Then our time is
ticking to infiltrate the lab</i>

1063
00:53:17,633 --> 00:53:19,008
<i>and get the card to the market,</i>

1064
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:20,507
<i>where I'll hand it off
to the Eye,</i>

1065
00:53:20,508 --> 00:53:21,788
<i>so we can all get the hell home.</i>

1066
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:42,716
Hannes, my old friend.

1067
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:44,424
So glad you could make it.

1068
00:53:44,425 --> 00:53:47,549
I knew you had a soft spot for
an old-school bidding war.

1069
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:48,675
How have you been?

1070
00:53:48,717 --> 00:53:50,841
I trust my people implicitly.

1071
00:53:50,842 --> 00:53:55,591
Certainly. But I'm sure you'd
like to see it for yourself.

1072
00:53:55,592 --> 00:53:58,425
Hold it in your hands,
check the build quality.

1073
00:54:00,717 --> 00:54:03,424
Or not. Also fine.

1074
00:54:03,425 --> 00:54:05,508
Well, if you'd like
to follow me.

1075
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:11,507
You'll have to
remove all your metal.

1076
00:54:11,508 --> 00:54:12,716
Watches, rings, etc.

1077
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:13,966
Yeah, of course.

1078
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:15,841
Excuse me for asking...

1079
00:54:15,842 --> 00:54:17,758
Where might I
have seen you before?

1080
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:21,507
I don't know, probably
one of my many symposiums.

1081
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,675
The book jacket!

1082
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,342
I have to say,
Dr. Michaelakis,

1083
00:54:24,383 --> 00:54:25,591
I'm a huge fan.

1084
00:54:25,592 --> 00:54:27,549
Thank you so much.

1085
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:31,008
Which book?
There have been so many.

1086
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,883
Does Hannes' chippy
always talk for you, Doctor?

1087
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:36,758
Doctor?

1088
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:43,341
Sorry, when you say "chippy," you
are referring to Buffy here, yeah?

1089
00:54:43,342 --> 00:54:44,508
Of course.

1090
00:54:46,425 --> 00:54:48,549
Hannes prefers the term "floozy"

1091
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:50,841
for all his boy toys.

1092
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:53,882
Yeah. He does. That's good.
Noted.

1093
00:54:53,883 --> 00:54:56,007
By the way, I got your email, Dr.
Michaelakis.

1094
00:54:56,008 --> 00:54:57,632
You had a query
about our ability

1095
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:59,757
to maintain quantum coherence
at room temperature

1096
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,675
without the use of dilution,
refrigerators,

1097
00:55:01,717 --> 00:55:04,424
or error correction.

1098
00:55:04,425 --> 00:55:06,008
Do you care to elucidate?

1099
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,549
Right.
Yeah.

1100
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,549
Yes, I did send that email.

1101
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,342
The other day, I saw you.
I did, I sent it.

1102
00:55:11,383 --> 00:55:12,591
So what gives?

1103
00:55:12,592 --> 00:55:14,008
I'm sorry, what gives...

1104
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,675
I think what
she's trying to say...

1105
00:55:15,717 --> 00:55:17,716
Actually, the grown-ups
are having a meeting, Buffy.

1106
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:19,008
Okay.

1107
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,466
If you'll hold on to that.

1108
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:22,299
Yeah, sure, Doctor.
Thank you.

1109
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,716
Now, every seventh grader,
even the dumb ones,

1110
00:55:24,717 --> 00:55:26,842
know the second law
of thermodynamics.

1111
00:55:26,883 --> 00:55:28,841
"All ordered systems
tend toward disorder."

1112
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:30,632
Disorder!

1113
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:34,508
So I'm going to ask you one
more time, sir, what gives?

1114
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:44,341
Well, it's actually
topological quantum order.

1115
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:47,424
The emergence of quantum effects
on a macroscopic level.

1116
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:50,383
So that is, in fact, what gives.

1117
00:55:55,383 --> 00:55:56,467
Thank you.

1118
00:56:02,842 --> 00:56:06,966
You know, Buffy is not
a bad name for you.

1119
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:10,675
You know, buff, firm, taut.

1120
00:56:10,717 --> 00:56:12,591
That's good. Did you just
find a thesaurus somewhere?

1121
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:13,882
Nubile.

1122
00:56:13,883 --> 00:56:15,632
- That's good.
- Thank you. Okay.

1123
00:56:15,633 --> 00:56:17,050
There we go.

1124
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,050
Sorry, sorry.

1125
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,507
The stick's metal. How are
we going to get it out?

1126
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:39,717
Yeah. I don't know.

1127
00:56:40,842 --> 00:56:42,716
This is the housing.

1128
00:56:42,717 --> 00:56:46,758
820 million qubit miles
of digi-synaptic resonance.

1129
00:56:52,717 --> 00:56:55,299
But of course, what sets us apart
from anything else on the planet

1130
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,841
is the processor,

1131
00:56:56,842 --> 00:56:59,842
which we playfully refer to
as the Magic Broomstick.

1132
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:00,966
The Broomstick?

1133
00:57:00,967 --> 00:57:02,424
Has the power to
clear the contents

1134
00:57:02,425 --> 00:57:04,757
of any computing
system on the planet

1135
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:07,549
and then magically
sweep them into your bin.

1136
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,299
Broomstick.
That's funny.

1137
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,966
Take a look,
vet it however you'd like,

1138
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:15,507
and tell Hannes we'll be
taking bids on Monday.

1139
00:57:15,508 --> 00:57:16,717
Thank you.

1140
00:57:18,717 --> 00:57:21,549
My God. I must be allergic
to something in here.

1141
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,341
What could you possibly be
allergic to in here?

1142
00:57:23,342 --> 00:57:24,622
This room is
hermetically sealed.

1143
00:57:24,883 --> 00:57:26,716
That's it.

1144
00:57:26,717 --> 00:57:30,549
If we could get him away
from the computer, please.

1145
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,966
That's the one thing.

1146
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:33,341
Just until he's recovered.

1147
00:57:33,342 --> 00:57:34,862
We're gonna need
some anti-bacterial...

1148
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:37,757
Do we have alcohol wipes?

1149
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:40,299
Your hands need to be sterile if
you intend to get any closer.

1150
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,508
Do I make myself clear?

1151
00:57:44,008 --> 00:57:45,591
Sorry. We couldn't...

1152
00:57:45,592 --> 00:57:46,882
No, I'm fine.

1153
00:57:46,883 --> 00:57:48,341
Take his medicine
into the country.

1154
00:57:48,342 --> 00:57:49,508
Yeah.

1155
00:57:52,842 --> 00:57:55,424
Can't risk any contamination.

1156
00:57:55,425 --> 00:57:58,008
You're gonna have to stay away
from the inner workings.

1157
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,549
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1158
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,341
All right. If you're done...
Here you go.

1159
00:58:01,342 --> 00:58:02,966
Sorry about this.
Okay. I'm okay.

1160
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:05,026
This happens to him sometimes.
It'll pass. Allergies.

1161
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:07,341
Allergies.
Nothing you can do.

1162
00:58:07,342 --> 00:58:09,342
Well, something
you could do, Doctor.

1163
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:30,425
Okay?

1164
00:58:37,425 --> 00:58:38,466
Search him, please.

1165
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:39,842
Didn't we just do that?

1166
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,842
Okay. I wanna run full
diagnostics on the system.

1167
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,050
This is completely unnecessary.

1168
00:59:16,592 --> 00:59:17,841
Up, up.

1169
00:59:17,842 --> 00:59:19,008
Okay.

1170
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,675
Hey! I can walk on my own.

1171
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,800
Whoa!

1172
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:53,508
Sorry.

1173
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,424
Hey!

1174
01:00:12,425 --> 01:00:14,424
I can do that myself.

1175
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:16,675
We just met, man.

1176
01:00:16,717 --> 01:00:18,008
Handsy, handsy, handsy.

1177
01:00:30,342 --> 01:00:31,383
Hey!

1178
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:34,966
My eyes are up here, man.

1179
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:36,508
How do you like it?

1180
01:00:58,883 --> 01:01:00,008
Hey, I'm good.

1181
01:01:01,717 --> 01:01:02,758
Turn around.

1182
01:01:20,842 --> 01:01:22,299
Do you have anything?

1183
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,883
I don't know.
Can't trust anybody.

1184
01:01:25,425 --> 01:01:26,591
I'm good.

1185
01:01:26,592 --> 01:01:27,675
They're clean.

1186
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:31,007
Do your final checks
and get them out of here.

1187
01:01:31,008 --> 01:01:33,508
We're walking
this way again. Yay.

1188
01:01:38,883 --> 01:01:42,633
I don't speak the language.

1189
01:01:48,883 --> 01:01:50,424
See?

1190
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:52,385
What did I tell you, man?
We didn't have anything.

1191
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,800
Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.

1192
01:02:11,717 --> 01:02:14,341
Something about
a big white dance floor,

1193
01:02:14,342 --> 01:02:15,549
makes me wanna boogie.

1194
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:17,008
Hey, thanks for having us.

1195
01:02:18,425 --> 01:02:20,425
That's great stuff.

1196
01:02:26,425 --> 01:02:30,342
You guys are pretty serious
about your security?

1197
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:35,342
Okay.

1198
01:02:35,383 --> 01:02:37,841
Do I have all my things?
I feel like I came in

1199
01:02:37,842 --> 01:02:39,682
with more stuff. Did I
come in with more stuff?

1200
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,675
You don't think so?

1201
01:02:45,842 --> 01:02:48,549
Sir, I think you
still have my wallet.

1202
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:51,341
Remember, I, gave it
to you when I came in?

1203
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:53,508
It would be nice
to leave with it.

1204
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,342
Wallet coming through.

1205
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:08,675
Sorry, my belt.

1206
01:03:15,883 --> 01:03:17,966
I guess that's
everything, right?

1207
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:19,299
Thank you.

1208
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,758
That is not a toy, Buffy. Sorry.

1209
01:03:26,883 --> 01:03:28,633
Go, go, go!

1210
01:03:35,008 --> 01:03:36,966
All right. Now,
drop me off at the market

1211
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:42,342
You asked me to call you when they started
running around like headless chickens.

1212
01:03:43,342 --> 01:03:44,675
Well, that's what's happening.

1213
01:03:59,425 --> 01:04:01,966
This is where your sources
told you they'd be?

1214
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:05,883
No, this is where my sources
said we might find an answer.

1215
01:04:16,967 --> 01:04:18,841
She must be familiar
with your work.

1216
01:04:18,842 --> 01:04:20,466
Excuse me.

1217
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:22,800
Miss, have you seen
these people?

1218
01:04:34,342 --> 01:04:36,675
She says her grandson
spoke to their leader.

1219
01:04:36,717 --> 01:04:37,883
He's in the back.

1220
01:04:38,592 --> 01:04:39,841
What?

1221
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:41,800
No "Wow, you speak Mandarin"?

1222
01:05:13,425 --> 01:05:15,592
The Coffin to the Beyond.

1223
01:05:16,883 --> 01:05:19,424
It was always a flap,

1224
01:05:19,425 --> 01:05:21,633
or a trap or mirrors.

1225
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:25,633
The audience thought
he'd just disappeared.

1226
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,300
But he was always
hidden somewhere inside.

1227
01:05:41,758 --> 01:05:46,591
I believe that's the prototype for
the one your father had made.

1228
01:05:46,592 --> 01:05:47,841
He, like many others
over the years,

1229
01:05:47,842 --> 01:05:49,082
ordered his supplies from here.

1230
01:05:52,008 --> 01:05:53,842
Of course.

1231
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,716
That's why you gave me the look

1232
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:57,674
when I said they were in Macau.

1233
01:05:57,675 --> 01:05:59,841
Your father used to come
here when you were young.

1234
01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:01,717
Can I please get
some space here?

1235
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:09,632
You think you're the only one
who'd wondered for 30 years

1236
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,424
what happened?

1237
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,008
You're not.

1238
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,549
Lionel was a master magician.

1239
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:17,007
Either he gamed the hinges,

1240
01:06:17,008 --> 01:06:20,675
so he could kick the door
and they would pop out,

1241
01:06:20,717 --> 01:06:23,299
or he had access to the
lock from the inside

1242
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,591
so he could pick it.

1243
01:06:24,592 --> 01:06:26,299
Word is

1244
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,424
the safe was made from
cheap metal, and it bowed.

1245
01:06:29,425 --> 01:06:34,966
Still, he always had
something up his sleeve.

1246
01:06:34,967 --> 01:06:39,008
Unless he'd reached the
limit of his capabilities

1247
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,758
and his clock ran out.

1248
01:06:46,425 --> 01:06:48,299
Excuse me.

1249
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,633
My grandmother has
something you might want.

1250
01:06:54,758 --> 01:06:56,966
This was your father's.

1251
01:06:56,967 --> 01:06:59,383
He had several of these made.

1252
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:19,675
And the Horsemen?

1253
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:23,424
I overheard them talking.

1254
01:07:23,425 --> 01:07:26,342
One of them, Atlas,
he's meeting someone

1255
01:07:26,383 --> 01:07:27,842
at the market nearby.

1256
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:46,757
As for former Agent Rhodes,

1257
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:49,507
his location is now
your number one priority.

1258
01:07:49,508 --> 01:07:51,675
We're putting out
an international APB.

1259
01:07:51,717 --> 01:07:54,008
Including cooperation
from local authorities.

1260
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:55,841
Agent Cowan.

1261
01:07:55,842 --> 01:07:57,675
I'm assuming it was
actually not you

1262
01:07:57,717 --> 01:07:59,507
who walked into
Newburgh Federal Prison,

1263
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:02,507
then walked out 30 minutes
later with Thaddeus Bradley?

1264
01:08:02,508 --> 01:08:04,508
What?
He used your ID.

1265
01:08:08,508 --> 01:08:10,550
What are you doing, Rhodes?

1266
01:08:37,842 --> 01:08:39,966
Atlas, hey.
Dylan.

1267
01:08:39,967 --> 01:08:41,632
I blew it, I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?

1268
01:08:41,633 --> 01:08:42,842
I'm here to help now.

1269
01:08:42,883 --> 01:08:44,382
Okay, we definitely
don't need your help.

1270
01:08:44,383 --> 01:08:45,675
I know I messed up, all right?

1271
01:08:45,717 --> 01:08:47,299
Yeah, you put everybody's
lives in danger.

1272
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,675
Where is everybody?
Where is everybody?

1273
01:08:49,717 --> 01:08:51,424
I can't be seen with you
actually, right now.

1274
01:08:51,425 --> 01:08:53,026
I got it now, okay?
I appreciate you taking

1275
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,359
the time to take control
for a little while.

1276
01:08:54,383 --> 01:08:55,549
Hey, I'm actually...
Yeah?

1277
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:57,299
Yeah, but I got it now,
all right? Yeah.

1278
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,966
You do? You look like you
can get some rest, buddy.

1279
01:08:58,967 --> 01:09:00,507
Who you meeting here?

1280
01:09:00,508 --> 01:09:01,882
I'm not meeting anybody.

1281
01:09:01,883 --> 01:09:03,526
They told me at long's
you were meeting somebody.

1282
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,508
At long's?

1283
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,342
Okay, yeah, no, I am, um...

1284
01:09:08,425 --> 01:09:10,841
I'm meeting somebody
from the Eye.

1285
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:15,341
To exchange this computer
chip for our lives back.

1286
01:09:15,342 --> 01:09:18,507
I hope you're happy with the
situation you've put us in.

1287
01:09:18,508 --> 01:09:19,966
You're talking to the Eye?

1288
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:21,299
Yeah.

1289
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,008
Why are you talking to the Eye?

1290
01:09:23,967 --> 01:09:25,549
Atlas.

1291
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,966
Atlas, give me the stick.

1292
01:09:26,967 --> 01:09:29,507
Dylan, you're not our
leader anymore, okay?

1293
01:09:29,508 --> 01:09:30,841
You're not our hero.

1294
01:09:30,842 --> 01:09:32,299
You're not FBI.

1295
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,632
You're not a magician.

1296
01:09:33,633 --> 01:09:35,299
You're not really anything.

1297
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,966
And we trusted you for a year.

1298
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:40,632
So if you really
wanna help us...

1299
01:09:40,633 --> 01:09:43,383
If you really wanna help
us, you would leave.

1300
01:09:51,675 --> 01:09:53,841
I get it. Cool.

1301
01:09:53,842 --> 01:09:54,883
Bye.

1302
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:16,342
Yeah, that was me you called
at the magic shop.

1303
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,799
So much fun though,

1304
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,341
knowing you'd be scurrying
away from me at the lab

1305
01:10:20,342 --> 01:10:21,632
just to bring it to me here.

1306
01:10:21,633 --> 01:10:23,507
Did you actually
think I'd let you go?

1307
01:10:23,508 --> 01:10:24,675
How did you do that?

1308
01:10:24,717 --> 01:10:26,299
Everyone has their button.

1309
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,675
You push it and they go blind.

1310
01:10:27,717 --> 01:10:29,758
And yours, obviously, is ego.

1311
01:10:30,508 --> 01:10:31,841
"Stay the course.

1312
01:10:31,842 --> 01:10:34,675
<i>"Great changes are in store.</i>

1313
01:10:34,717 --> 01:10:37,342
<i>"Trust that your unique talents</i>

1314
01:10:37,383 --> 01:10:38,883
"will not go
unrecognized."

1315
01:10:40,008 --> 01:10:41,674
That was you.
Yeah.

1316
01:10:41,675 --> 01:10:43,299
Merritt downloaded
all the files,

1317
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,967
but how do you think
we were able to find him?

1318
01:10:48,967 --> 01:10:51,008
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

1319
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,967
What you actually put your phone
on was a bi-wave siphon pad.

1320
01:10:55,675 --> 01:10:57,841
<i>Once again,</i>

1321
01:10:57,842 --> 01:11:00,424
science beats magic.

1322
01:11:00,425 --> 01:11:02,758
So, the stick?
No.

1323
01:11:05,758 --> 01:11:06,841
I got it!

1324
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:08,425
I got it. I got it.

1325
01:11:10,383 --> 01:11:12,342
Fuck, Dylan!
Wait, leave them!

1326
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,841
You really think I'm gonna
walk away from you?

1327
01:11:13,842 --> 01:11:15,966
Give me the stick!

1328
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:19,008
All right. Don't ever
question me again.

1329
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:20,300
Beat it!

1330
01:11:31,508 --> 01:11:33,633
So, the stick.
Go to hell.

1331
01:11:34,425 --> 01:11:35,467
Boys.

1332
01:11:47,758 --> 01:11:49,758
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1333
01:12:05,883 --> 01:12:07,507
There's like 10 of you.

1334
01:12:07,508 --> 01:12:09,382
Come on, he's just doing tricks.

1335
01:12:09,383 --> 01:12:11,342
He's there!
Go!

1336
01:13:34,717 --> 01:13:38,758
Dylan, watch the pretty birdies fly.
And sleep.

1337
01:13:39,842 --> 01:13:40,924
Doesn't work on me.

1338
01:13:40,925 --> 01:13:43,342
Not even as a distraction?

1339
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:48,550
Good job.
Nice to be involved.

1340
01:13:56,675 --> 01:13:58,799
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

1341
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,424
I just saw Dylan.
Um, something happened.

1342
01:14:00,425 --> 01:14:01,549
What do you mean
you just saw Dylan?

1343
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:03,632
Dylan's here?
What happened?

1344
01:14:03,633 --> 01:14:06,050
- Atlas.
- I don't know.

1345
01:14:10,883 --> 01:14:12,299
What are they doing?

1346
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,675
Those are Walter's men.

1347
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:17,841
This is what they want.

1348
01:14:17,842 --> 01:14:20,050
What the hell? How do
you still have that?

1349
01:14:24,967 --> 01:14:26,841
Whoa. That's
Lionel Shrike's safe.

1350
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:29,507
What the hell
do they want with that?

1351
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:31,341
Okay, we gotta
follow that truck.

1352
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:34,675
They must have Dylan.
We don't have much time.

1353
01:14:38,967 --> 01:14:40,424
What do you want?

1354
01:14:40,425 --> 01:14:44,008
You to understand something
very important.

1355
01:14:44,967 --> 01:14:46,632
We

1356
01:14:46,633 --> 01:14:48,424
Are mirror images.

1357
01:14:48,425 --> 01:14:52,008
I share a very deep
connection with my father.

1358
01:14:53,467 --> 01:14:55,966
And like you,
I'll stop at nothing

1359
01:14:55,967 --> 01:14:58,467
to avenge any wrongs
done to him.

1360
01:15:02,925 --> 01:15:06,632
You know the only difference
between your father and mine?

1361
01:15:06,633 --> 01:15:08,592
Mine's still alive.

1362
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,508
Get him up.

1363
01:15:23,842 --> 01:15:25,549
So,

1364
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:28,382
this is the man

1365
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,508
who spent a lifetime
plotting against me.

1366
01:15:33,508 --> 01:15:35,799
I wouldn't have known your face

1367
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,466
if it had been on a billboard
outside my bedroom window.

1368
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:41,675
But you have spent,
what, 30 years

1369
01:15:41,717 --> 01:15:43,049
thinking about mine?

1370
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,675
When my father died,

1371
01:15:44,717 --> 01:15:46,693
your insurance company
denied my mother her claims.

1372
01:15:46,717 --> 01:15:48,026
I wouldn't even have known...
She died a pauper!

1373
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,966
Who your mother was.

1374
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:51,008
She was a digit,

1375
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:54,675
a nanobyte in a stream of data.

1376
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,674
Because nothing
is personal to you

1377
01:15:56,675 --> 01:15:58,924
and everyone and everything is
just a number, isn't that so?

1378
01:15:58,925 --> 01:16:01,675
That is where you are wrong, Mr.
Rhodes.

1379
01:16:01,717 --> 01:16:06,675
Once you made yourself known
it became very personal.

1380
01:16:07,842 --> 01:16:09,757
My son...
Yeah, the sociopath.

1381
01:16:09,758 --> 01:16:11,299
Funny thing is,

1382
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,549
I have seven so-called
legitimate children.

1383
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,049
Sniveling, snobbish,

1384
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:17,966
stupid runts.

1385
01:16:17,967 --> 01:16:21,549
I have one illegitimate child
who is a lot like me.

1386
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,924
The point is,
he wants something,

1387
01:16:23,925 --> 01:16:25,632
and like any good parent,

1388
01:16:25,633 --> 01:16:28,008
I will stop at nothing

1389
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,341
to get it for him.

1390
01:16:29,342 --> 01:16:31,008
Your Horsemen have it.

1391
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:33,549
You will turn it and them

1392
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,507
over to us, now.

1393
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:36,675
No.

1394
01:16:40,383 --> 01:16:42,966
Dylan, I would like you to
really take this moment

1395
01:16:42,967 --> 01:16:44,675
because this is the consequence

1396
01:16:44,717 --> 01:16:46,674
of your personal
vendetta come to life

1397
01:16:46,675 --> 01:16:48,549
and staring you in the face.

1398
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:50,299
I want you to know
that when you're gone,

1399
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:53,674
We're gonna destroy
everything you believe in,

1400
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:55,841
starting with the Horsemen,
and ending with the Eye.

1401
01:16:55,842 --> 01:16:57,757
Now then, cast your mind back

1402
01:16:57,758 --> 01:17:00,924
to standing by the banks of the
river watching your father descend,

1403
01:17:00,925 --> 01:17:02,966
disgraced and discredited.

1404
01:17:02,967 --> 01:17:05,842
The horrid psychic pain
as you have relived for years.

1405
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:08,675
I felt that same thing

1406
01:17:08,717 --> 01:17:11,549
as you drained not
just my father's fortune,

1407
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,632
but his dignity!

1408
01:17:13,633 --> 01:17:15,675
And yet you took
pleasure from it.

1409
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:21,008
This should bring back
some childhood memories.

1410
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:50,425
Would you like some tea?
Thank you.

1411
01:18:05,842 --> 01:18:08,342
You ready?
Over to you.

1412
01:18:15,342 --> 01:18:16,425
Splash!

1413
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,342
Job done!

1414
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,841
Hell is going to seem
like a day at the spa

1415
01:18:39,842 --> 01:18:42,799
by the time we're through
with these Horsemen.

1416
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,592
- Wouldn't you say?
- You had me at "hell."

1417
01:19:02,425 --> 01:19:04,800
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1418
01:19:07,383 --> 01:19:09,758
Always keep something
up my sleeve.

1419
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:31,674
I wish I could dredge
from the muck of my soul

1420
01:20:31,675 --> 01:20:33,841
one speck of remorse,

1421
01:20:33,842 --> 01:20:35,799
but I can't.

1422
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,049
So I'll stick to
the business at hand

1423
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:41,633
and try not to smile
too broadly.

1424
01:20:42,383 --> 01:20:45,299
And, thank you

1425
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,675
for delivering
Mr. Dylan Rhodes.

1426
01:20:48,467 --> 01:20:50,342
I take it it's done.

1427
01:20:51,508 --> 01:20:53,550
Literally hit the bottom.

1428
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:55,008
Now,

1429
01:20:55,967 --> 01:20:57,757
where are the Horsemen?

1430
01:20:57,758 --> 01:20:59,757
They're performers.

1431
01:20:59,758 --> 01:21:02,008
Their pride, their ego...

1432
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:05,507
Their need to be adored
are all too powerful

1433
01:21:05,508 --> 01:21:07,424
to keep them out of
the limelight for long.

1434
01:21:07,425 --> 01:21:10,632
If they don't make
themselves known,

1435
01:21:10,633 --> 01:21:12,924
you will find yourself

1436
01:21:12,925 --> 01:21:15,424
in a very similar position

1437
01:21:15,425 --> 01:21:16,966
to Mr. Rhodes.

1438
01:21:16,967 --> 01:21:18,799
Are we clear about that?

1439
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,883
As clear as the water
he's under.

1440
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:30,049
You'll have the rest

1441
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:31,925
when I have the Horsemen.

1442
01:22:04,008 --> 01:22:05,342
Dylan!

1443
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:08,966
Dylan, come on, buddy, breathe!

1444
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:10,424
- Dylan.
- Dylan?

1445
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,550
Dylan, come on!

1446
01:22:16,675 --> 01:22:19,507
You're okay.

1447
01:22:19,508 --> 01:22:22,341
Jesus! You scared
the hell out of us, man.

1448
01:22:22,342 --> 01:22:23,550
Are you all right, bro?

1449
01:22:23,842 --> 01:22:25,966
Okay!

1450
01:22:25,967 --> 01:22:27,966
Thank you! This is the
least I could do.

1451
01:22:27,967 --> 01:22:29,966
No. There's a hell of a lot
less you could've done.

1452
01:22:29,967 --> 01:22:31,466
That was not an option.

1453
01:22:31,467 --> 01:22:33,424
You took a bullet
for us, it was huge.

1454
01:22:33,425 --> 01:22:34,717
You really did, man.

1455
01:22:37,967 --> 01:22:39,758
Thanks for pulling me out.
Seriously.

1456
01:22:40,675 --> 01:22:42,007
Yeah.

1457
01:22:42,008 --> 01:22:44,341
You got yourself out.
We did the easy part.

1458
01:22:44,342 --> 01:22:45,966
Literally, in my case,

1459
01:22:45,967 --> 01:22:47,341
I was just standing on the
shore while Atlas jumped down

1460
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:48,424
and got you.

1461
01:22:48,425 --> 01:22:50,008
I'm serious.

1462
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:51,966
Hey, you guys.
Something's not right.

1463
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,425
- What's wrong?
- What?

1464
01:22:55,425 --> 01:22:56,507
It's fake.

1465
01:22:56,508 --> 01:22:57,758
What?

1466
01:22:59,467 --> 01:23:00,966
No, I had the stick.

1467
01:23:00,967 --> 01:23:03,049
The actual stick.
I swear, it was in my hand.

1468
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:05,674
In the lab. And then I put
it in the little case thing.

1469
01:23:05,675 --> 01:23:06,841
And I gave it to Atlas.

1470
01:23:06,842 --> 01:23:10,841
Is there any chance you've possibly
misplaced it at any point?

1471
01:23:10,842 --> 01:23:14,841
I took it from you and then
slipped it back in your coat

1472
01:23:14,842 --> 01:23:16,841
when I pushed you out.

1473
01:23:16,842 --> 01:23:19,674
Either way, we're left holding
a whole sack full of nada.

1474
01:23:19,675 --> 01:23:22,424
Yeah, but they're gonna come after
us as if we do have something.

1475
01:23:22,425 --> 01:23:24,674
No. Okay. I agree that
somebody got the better of us.

1476
01:23:24,675 --> 01:23:28,382
But I don't agree that we
have a sack full of nada.

1477
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:29,591
Because we're all here.

1478
01:23:29,592 --> 01:23:31,592
That's a sack full of something.

1479
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:39,341
We all know that Walter is not going
to stop until he gets that chip.

1480
01:23:39,342 --> 01:23:42,841
And we're the only ones that
even know that he's alive.

1481
01:23:42,842 --> 01:23:45,549
We can't just walk away.

1482
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:47,592
That's not what the Horsemen do.

1483
01:23:50,342 --> 01:23:52,049
There's a quote. Um...

1484
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,674
It's actually by the magician

1485
01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:55,466
that made me wanna do this
in the first place.

1486
01:23:55,467 --> 01:23:57,466
It's...

1487
01:23:57,467 --> 01:24:01,799
"A magician's greatest power
lies forever shrouded

1488
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,049
"in his empty fist."

1489
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:06,591
"And the very idea that
he can convince the world

1490
01:24:06,592 --> 01:24:09,757
"that he is, in fact,
carrying with him a secret."

1491
01:24:09,758 --> 01:24:11,424
That's Lionel Shrike.

1492
01:24:11,425 --> 01:24:12,508
Right.

1493
01:24:13,842 --> 01:24:17,758
That we should pretend like
we have something we don't?

1494
01:24:21,383 --> 01:24:22,883
What is Walter's greatest fear?

1495
01:24:23,508 --> 01:24:25,341
Being seen.

1496
01:24:25,342 --> 01:24:26,549
And what does the stick do?

1497
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:28,841
The stick can unencode anything.

1498
01:24:28,842 --> 01:24:32,299
It can open up a back door
into any computer

1499
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,841
on the planet.

1500
01:24:33,842 --> 01:24:35,675
Including his.
Yeah.

1501
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,966
Right, we not only make him
think that we have it,

1502
01:24:39,967 --> 01:24:44,299
but that we're going to use it
to expose and destroy him.

1503
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,424
We need a plan.

1504
01:24:45,425 --> 01:24:47,674
But we don't have time.

1505
01:24:47,675 --> 01:24:51,299
We have each other and
there are five of us.

1506
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:54,341
But we also need supplies, right?
And resources.

1507
01:24:54,342 --> 01:24:57,549
And probably more
than five people.

1508
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:01,507
Do you really think
you don't have help?

1509
01:25:01,508 --> 01:25:04,382
She speaks English.
Of course. Yeah.

1510
01:25:04,383 --> 01:25:09,799
Do you know why the Fool is the
most powerful card in the tarot?

1511
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,549
Not because the person
who draws him is a fool.

1512
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:15,049
He's a fool

1513
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:17,966
because he's a clean slate,

1514
01:25:17,967 --> 01:25:20,507
and, therefore, can become

1515
01:25:20,508 --> 01:25:21,966
anything.

1516
01:25:21,967 --> 01:25:23,467
You were chosen.

1517
01:25:24,008 --> 01:25:25,924
All of you.

1518
01:25:25,925 --> 01:25:28,507
Not because of who you are,

1519
01:25:28,508 --> 01:25:31,342
but because of who
you might become.

1520
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,007
When you say "chosen"...

1521
01:25:34,008 --> 01:25:36,674
Are you part of the Eye?

1522
01:25:36,675 --> 01:25:37,841
Yes.

1523
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:40,841
We are part of the Eye.

1524
01:25:40,842 --> 01:25:44,050
You've each
doubted our existence.

1525
01:25:44,842 --> 01:25:46,716
Wondering

1526
01:25:46,717 --> 01:25:49,342
if we, indeed, were watching.

1527
01:25:52,842 --> 01:25:54,382
We are.

1528
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:56,507
We always have been.

1529
01:25:56,508 --> 01:25:59,007
This is the best
magic shop in the world.

1530
01:25:59,008 --> 01:26:00,299
You know what
she's saying, right?

1531
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:01,424
Yes.

1532
01:26:01,425 --> 01:26:03,758
That now we have
resources and help.

1533
01:26:05,592 --> 01:26:06,925
Thank you.

1534
01:26:09,425 --> 01:26:11,050
So, who's in?

1535
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:16,299
I'm in.

1536
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,592
Yeah, I'm in.

1537
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:21,467
Let's do this.

1538
01:26:38,967 --> 01:26:40,758
No, no, no.

1539
01:26:43,425 --> 01:26:45,549
<i>Not long ago, we were tricked.</i>

1540
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:48,591
<i>I was exposed and brought
back from the dead.</i>

1541
01:26:48,592 --> 01:26:51,466
<i>So we thought it was only fitting
that we do the same thing</i>

1542
01:26:51,467 --> 01:26:53,382
<i>to the person who did it to us.</i>

1543
01:26:53,383 --> 01:26:55,841
<i>Midnight, New Year's Eve.
London.</i>

1544
01:26:55,842 --> 01:26:57,591
<i>We will be performing
a series of shows</i>

1545
01:26:57,592 --> 01:26:59,299
<i>that all connect
to our big finale,</i>

1546
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:01,466
<i>so pay close attention
to each trick.</i>

1547
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:02,633
Get my father.

1548
01:27:04,675 --> 01:27:09,007
I want Interpol, Scotland Yard,
whoever we have in London.

1549
01:27:09,008 --> 01:27:10,466
What do we know about Rhodes?

1550
01:27:10,467 --> 01:27:12,424
Wherever the Horsemen are,
that's where he is.

1551
01:27:12,425 --> 01:27:19,299
<i>Because we, too, will bring
someone back from the dead.</i>

1552
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,966
Let's move, everyone!

1553
01:27:20,967 --> 01:27:22,966
<i>In front of the largest
stage in the world...</i>

1554
01:27:22,967 --> 01:27:24,966
<i>The actual world.</i>

1555
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:27,007
You know they're
playing you, right?

1556
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:28,841
Leading you into a trap?

1557
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:30,716
Yeah, but the threat is real.

1558
01:27:30,717 --> 01:27:33,382
This card can hack into any system
on the planet, including ours.

1559
01:27:33,383 --> 01:27:35,674
They have it, why wouldn't
they use it to expose us?

1560
01:27:35,675 --> 01:27:37,341
Me. Everything we've done.

1561
01:27:37,342 --> 01:27:39,425
Is it real,
Mr. McKinney?

1562
01:27:46,675 --> 01:27:47,924
The threat is real.

1563
01:27:47,925 --> 01:27:50,382
So, how do we stay
ahead of them?

1564
01:27:50,383 --> 01:27:52,758
We need to get
to London by midnight.

1565
01:28:01,425 --> 01:28:05,549
<i>On this New Year's Eve, and
the crowds are out in force.</i>

1566
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:06,966
<i>Locals and tourists alike</i>

1567
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:09,341
<i>getting ready for
the party of the year.</i>

1568
01:28:09,342 --> 01:28:11,341
<i>A video gone viral
from the infamous</i>

1569
01:28:11,342 --> 01:28:13,299
<i>Horsemen magicians has surfaced.</i>

1570
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:18,049
<i>But will it end in their
arrest on national television?</i>

1571
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:19,841
<i>Or some sort of vindication?</i>

1572
01:28:19,842 --> 01:28:25,883
<i>But we do know, wherever, whenever
that is, people will be watching.</i>

1573
01:28:28,425 --> 01:28:30,674
Yeah, texts, tweets, Instagrams.

1574
01:28:30,675 --> 01:28:33,424
Anything that says "Horsemen,"
brags about seeing the Horsemen,

1575
01:28:33,425 --> 01:28:35,049
tag them and bundle them.

1576
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:37,591
Dad, who do we have security-wise
on this? Your guys?

1577
01:28:37,592 --> 01:28:40,424
Well, we want all of them
and all their friends.

1578
01:28:40,425 --> 01:28:44,800
Stationed throughout the city, so
they can be anywhere in 60 seconds.

1579
01:28:58,925 --> 01:29:01,383
Hello! Hey!

1580
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,799
My name's Jack Wilder.

1581
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,841
Goddamn, it feels
good to be back.

1582
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,341
All right, gather around.

1583
01:29:10,342 --> 01:29:14,299
I wanna talk to you about
something real quick.

1584
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:17,757
You all know Three Card Monte,
also known as "Find the Lady"?

1585
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:22,049
Trick performed by street hustlers all
over the world. And why street hustlers?

1586
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:24,674
Because as soon as you walk up
to the table, you lose.

1587
01:29:24,675 --> 01:29:26,800
Every time.
Let me demonstrate.

1588
01:29:27,883 --> 01:29:33,716
While we're at it, let's find
ourselves a life-sized Queen.

1589
01:29:33,717 --> 01:29:35,758
Ma'am, would you
mind being my Queen?

1590
01:29:38,967 --> 01:29:40,924
Don't worry.
I promise you

1591
01:29:40,925 --> 01:29:42,799
there's a 50% chance you'll
get her back after the show.

1592
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,674
Head over there.
Thank you very much.

1593
01:29:44,675 --> 01:29:48,341
All right. Let's find ourselves
some Jacks to serve our Queen!

1594
01:29:48,342 --> 01:29:49,632
<i>Trust me, gentlemen.</i>

1595
01:29:49,633 --> 01:29:51,841
I know how these guys work now.

1596
01:29:51,842 --> 01:29:53,507
They're gonna start
with a tease.

1597
01:29:53,508 --> 01:29:55,549
A few little pop-ups.

1598
01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:58,507
<i>Something to
lure you in. Like...</i>

1599
01:29:58,508 --> 01:30:02,674
Well, you know... Like Three
Card Monte, where the guy goes,

1600
01:30:02,675 --> 01:30:05,382
"Looky here,
but no, no, looky here!"

1601
01:30:05,383 --> 01:30:09,382
<i>Except when all these
little tricks are done,</i>

1602
01:30:09,383 --> 01:30:11,507
<i>the only thing
you're gonna be looking at</i>

1603
01:30:11,508 --> 01:30:15,591
is the inside of your own
colon, with the words

1604
01:30:15,592 --> 01:30:18,592
<i>"Horsemen" written all over it.</i>

1605
01:30:19,342 --> 01:30:20,841
In blood.

1606
01:30:20,842 --> 01:30:24,466
We get the picture,
Mr. McKinney.

1607
01:30:24,467 --> 01:30:26,841
And get out of my chair.

1608
01:30:26,842 --> 01:30:28,799
<i>Hello, everybody!</i>

1609
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,841
<i>Come close, come on!</i>

1610
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,841
All right, all right, so listen.

1611
01:30:32,842 --> 01:30:36,632
Tonight, I am going
to make something fly

1612
01:30:36,633 --> 01:30:38,466
using actual magic.

1613
01:30:38,467 --> 01:30:40,341
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

1614
01:30:40,342 --> 01:30:43,424
I'm going to take
a very large vessel,

1615
01:30:43,425 --> 01:30:47,674
I'm gonna make it fly over
there and land on the Thames.

1616
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:49,674
Can you handle that?

1617
01:30:49,675 --> 01:30:51,382
Same rules apply as before.

1618
01:30:51,383 --> 01:30:53,507
All you need to do is
keep your eye on the Queen.

1619
01:30:53,508 --> 01:30:54,841
It's as simple as that.

1620
01:30:54,842 --> 01:30:56,674
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah!

1621
01:30:56,675 --> 01:30:59,507
Dad, look at this.

1622
01:30:59,508 --> 01:31:02,674
Near the river. Looks like
the shows are starting.

1623
01:31:02,675 --> 01:31:04,674
But we're not the only ones
who found them.

1624
01:31:04,675 --> 01:31:06,383
What do you mean?
It's on Channel One.

1625
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:15,841
- Let's go to 2.
- Here we go.

1626
01:31:15,842 --> 01:31:18,549
Got him.
We have a location.

1627
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:20,549
It's Jack Wilder.
Here come the Horsemen.

1628
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:22,592
Okay, we're moving.
Let's go, let's go.

1629
01:31:26,008 --> 01:31:28,758
Turn around. Hide
yourselves with the cards.

1630
01:31:29,425 --> 01:31:31,550
And here we go.

1631
01:31:33,967 --> 01:31:35,382
You guys still
have your eye on her?

1632
01:31:35,383 --> 01:31:36,383
You want me to
go back and do it?

1633
01:31:36,384 --> 01:31:37,841
Okay, all right.
I'm moving on.

1634
01:31:37,842 --> 01:31:39,508
And switch.

1635
01:31:41,425 --> 01:31:42,508
Where is she?

1636
01:31:43,717 --> 01:31:45,841
Down at the end?
You sure?

1637
01:31:45,842 --> 01:31:48,716
All right, can I get a drumroll
from my man in the back?

1638
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:50,342
Thank you very much.

1639
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:59,007
There's my girl.

1640
01:31:59,008 --> 01:32:01,507
Not my girl.
100% your girl.

1641
01:32:01,508 --> 01:32:03,299
But just in this situation.

1642
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,841
Okay, but I gotta warm up
a little bit first. Okay?

1643
01:32:05,842 --> 01:32:09,841
So, let me just make
something small fly, like...

1644
01:32:09,842 --> 01:32:11,966
Fly, fly, fly!

1645
01:32:11,967 --> 01:32:13,799
Wow, right?
Look at that!

1646
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,591
Aw. Come on, people.

1647
01:32:15,592 --> 01:32:18,549
Tough crowd. You, fly!

1648
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:19,758
Me?
Check your fly.

1649
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:24,841
You like that?

1650
01:32:24,842 --> 01:32:26,841
You support that relationship?

1651
01:32:26,842 --> 01:32:29,800
That guy had a bird in his pants.
That's disgusting.

1652
01:32:33,467 --> 01:32:35,549
<i>Copy that. We've got
two sightings reported.</i>

1653
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,549
<i>Heading to Greenwich Market.
Get me Thaddeus.</i>

1654
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:40,841
<i>Thaddeus, the FBI are here.
They're moving.</i>

1655
01:32:40,842 --> 01:32:42,591
<i>Let 'em move.</i>

1656
01:32:42,592 --> 01:32:45,799
Well, what if they get there first?
That can't happen.

1657
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,966
<i>I guarantee you, they won't.</i>

1658
01:32:47,967 --> 01:32:49,383
Find the pattern.

1659
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:51,591
You do that,

1660
01:32:51,592 --> 01:32:53,674
and you'll be able
to cut them off

1661
01:32:53,675 --> 01:32:55,674
<i>before they get to
their final trick.</i>

1662
01:32:55,675 --> 01:32:57,341
If it makes you feel better,

1663
01:32:57,342 --> 01:32:59,508
I'll take care of the FBI.

1664
01:33:13,675 --> 01:33:15,299
I guess you found me!

1665
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,799
We've got a third spot.

1666
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,467
Okay, everybody,
we're getting a pattern.

1667
01:33:21,675 --> 01:33:23,675
Um... Give me 2,

1668
01:33:24,925 --> 01:33:26,800
13 and 21.

1669
01:33:27,842 --> 01:33:28,883
What the hell is that?

1670
01:33:29,675 --> 01:33:30,758
Freeze that and zoom in.

1671
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,674
How the hell did this happen?

1672
01:33:35,675 --> 01:33:38,882
He's dead. We watched him drown.
How the hell did this happen?

1673
01:33:38,883 --> 01:33:41,299
Given that it did happen,
the pertinent question is,

1674
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:42,549
what are we gonna do about it?

1675
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:43,966
We're gonna stop him, Dad.
We'll stop him.

1676
01:33:43,967 --> 01:33:45,632
Where's my coat?

1677
01:33:45,633 --> 01:33:48,466
Walter, for the record,
I never loved the safe idea.

1678
01:33:48,467 --> 01:33:49,966
I know where they're going.

1679
01:33:49,967 --> 01:33:52,674
The next show is Merritt's
and it's by the river.

1680
01:33:52,675 --> 01:33:56,300
So we can find the Horsemen's
entry point for the finale.

1681
01:34:01,842 --> 01:34:03,424
<i>I've a confession to make.</i>

1682
01:34:03,425 --> 01:34:05,674
I've been told I have
some control issues.

1683
01:34:05,675 --> 01:34:09,007
I've learned that it's really,
really hard to control people,

1684
01:34:09,008 --> 01:34:11,007
so I'm gonna try
to control something

1685
01:34:11,008 --> 01:34:13,007
that's a lot easier than people.

1686
01:34:13,008 --> 01:34:14,549
I'm gonna try to
control the weather.

1687
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:16,717
Yeah, rain, um...

1688
01:34:18,842 --> 01:34:20,591
It'd be a little difficult
to make it rain, right?

1689
01:34:20,592 --> 01:34:23,507
That would be something
that only God can do, right?

1690
01:34:23,508 --> 01:34:25,799
I'm gonna do something
that God can't do.

1691
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,716
I'm not just gonna make it clear up.
No, no, no.

1692
01:34:28,717 --> 01:34:30,883
I'm gonna make it actually stop.

1693
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:45,466
And can God do that?

1694
01:34:45,467 --> 01:34:47,466
No, I don't think so.

1695
01:34:47,467 --> 01:34:49,800
Or what about make it go up?

1696
01:34:57,467 --> 01:34:59,507
<i>Are you still with me?</i>

1697
01:34:59,508 --> 01:35:01,424
Watch the Queen on the left.
Let's do it.

1698
01:35:01,425 --> 01:35:02,633
Turn around.

1699
01:35:05,842 --> 01:35:07,008
Switch!

1700
01:35:10,717 --> 01:35:11,924
Show me the lady.

1701
01:35:11,925 --> 01:35:14,841
Show me the lady!

1702
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:16,008
The end? End?

1703
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:20,710
You know what? I'm actually
starting to feel kinda bad.

1704
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:23,341
It's just because
I can actually feel

1705
01:35:23,342 --> 01:35:24,799
that you guys are
paying attention.

1706
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:29,300
You know, it's unfortunate that
it's the wrong kind of attention.

1707
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:33,717
Yeah, we need a fresher bird.

1708
01:35:34,842 --> 01:35:38,007
He's so cute. He's so cute!

1709
01:35:38,008 --> 01:35:40,841
Let's kill him, right?

1710
01:35:40,842 --> 01:35:42,924
Merritt, move into position.

1711
01:35:42,925 --> 01:35:44,882
Got it, Dylan.

1712
01:35:44,883 --> 01:35:46,674
I'm on my way.
I'll see you there.

1713
01:35:46,675 --> 01:35:49,049
Lula, stand by, all right?

1714
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:51,592
Or, what about just go,
I don't know, just go insane?

1715
01:36:00,925 --> 01:36:03,341
<i>Reports are coming in
from all over London</i>

1716
01:36:03,342 --> 01:36:07,050
<i>as the Horsemen appear to have taken
over the whole city for their show.</i>

1717
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:13,841
Hey, broski-whaddya-knowski?
Where you headed?

1718
01:36:13,842 --> 01:36:15,341
Please, bro, don't do this.
Where are you headed?

1719
01:36:15,342 --> 01:36:17,050
North, south, east?

1720
01:36:17,925 --> 01:36:19,549
East. Tower of London?

1721
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:22,424
Tower Bridge? Near Tower Bridge?
The Thames!

1722
01:36:22,425 --> 01:36:25,674
You're going to
the Thamesy-Whemsy!

1723
01:36:25,675 --> 01:36:27,507
You're so easy!

1724
01:36:27,508 --> 01:36:29,674
Bro, if there's any chance of us
ever having a relationship...

1725
01:36:29,675 --> 01:36:32,299
There's not.
Where's your entry?

1726
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:34,507
South Bank? Greenwich?

1727
01:36:34,508 --> 01:36:35,966
Greenwich.

1728
01:36:35,967 --> 01:36:39,008
I know where
you're going. I know where...

1729
01:36:40,967 --> 01:36:42,508
Watch it, hobo.

1730
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:47,842
Hey, Merritt. Come on.
Tell me you're kidding. How?

1731
01:36:49,592 --> 01:36:50,966
When?

1732
01:36:50,967 --> 01:36:53,716
Shit. All right.
All right, I got it.

1733
01:36:53,717 --> 01:36:55,842
Don't worry about it.
I'll warn the others.

1734
01:36:58,717 --> 01:37:00,508
Sorry. Just...

1735
01:37:03,008 --> 01:37:04,299
What? I just told you...

1736
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,342
Phone call.

1737
01:37:06,675 --> 01:37:07,799
- Hello?
<i>- Lula.</i>

1738
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,049
Dylan. Yeah.

1739
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:11,341
Kind of in the middle
of something right now.

1740
01:37:11,342 --> 01:37:13,466
<i>Wrap it up. Meet me at the
rendezvous point now.</i>

1741
01:37:13,467 --> 01:37:14,508
What?
<i>Now!</i>

1742
01:37:15,842 --> 01:37:17,841
Was that an act of God?

1743
01:37:17,842 --> 01:37:21,007
No. No, no, no,
that was an act of me

1744
01:37:21,008 --> 01:37:22,507
and the strobe lights

1745
01:37:22,508 --> 01:37:24,382
and rain machines.

1746
01:37:24,383 --> 01:37:26,382
And I hope you guys
were paying attention.

1747
01:37:26,383 --> 01:37:28,743
Because you're gonna need to
know all of that for the final.

1748
01:37:32,008 --> 01:37:33,799
<i>So how did I do it?</i>

1749
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,299
Did I use a Barry Trap?

1750
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,924
Maybe some switches
or a few duplicates?

1751
01:37:36,925 --> 01:37:38,341
<i>Jack, go now!</i>

1752
01:37:38,342 --> 01:37:39,841
You know what?
I hate to say it.

1753
01:37:39,842 --> 01:37:41,674
You're gonna have to wait to find out.
I know.

1754
01:37:41,675 --> 01:37:43,592
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love you all.

1755
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:48,674
<i>Lula, go!</i>

1756
01:37:48,675 --> 01:37:50,842
I have to go.

1757
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:11,632
<i>Out of the way, FBI!</i>

1758
01:38:11,633 --> 01:38:13,841
Move, move, move! Go!

1759
01:38:13,842 --> 01:38:15,674
Get some men in that park!

1760
01:38:15,675 --> 01:38:19,007
You gonna fill up on appetizers?

1761
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:21,799
Or save room for
the main course?

1762
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,674
Where the hell are the Horsemen?

1763
01:38:23,675 --> 01:38:27,592
You're just gonna wind up
holding your own tails.

1764
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:31,424
Or, you can let them
come to you.

1765
01:38:31,425 --> 01:38:32,966
So, what's it gonna be?

1766
01:38:32,967 --> 01:38:34,342
Chase them?

1767
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:36,633
Or make a deal with me?

1768
01:38:42,925 --> 01:38:44,841
Again? How did we
get found out again?

1769
01:38:44,842 --> 01:38:46,674
It's fine, it's fine.
We'll just cut to the finale.

1770
01:38:46,675 --> 01:38:48,382
Where's Merritt?
Fine. I don't know.

1771
01:38:48,383 --> 01:38:49,424
I'm here.

1772
01:38:49,425 --> 01:38:51,341
Where's Lula?
I'm right here!

1773
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:53,299
What the hell happened?

1774
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:55,007
My goddamn brother happened.
Don't worry about it.

1775
01:38:55,008 --> 01:38:56,341
We just gotta get
to the destination.

1776
01:38:56,342 --> 01:38:57,424
Lula, can you handle that thing?

1777
01:38:57,425 --> 01:38:58,882
I can ride it.

1778
01:38:58,883 --> 01:39:00,341
Have you asked the guys
that question, or just me?

1779
01:39:00,342 --> 01:39:01,424
Yeah, good point.

1780
01:39:01,425 --> 01:39:02,842
Let's go!
No, Jack.

1781
01:39:07,842 --> 01:39:08,883
Shit!

1782
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,342
Jack's down.
We gotta get him.

1783
01:39:16,592 --> 01:39:17,717
Come on, move!

1784
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:25,466
- Jack! Go, go!
- That's the brake.

1785
01:39:25,467 --> 01:39:27,007
That's the gas.
You'll figure it out.

1786
01:39:27,008 --> 01:39:28,842
Come on, follow me!

1787
01:39:29,967 --> 01:39:31,008
That's it?

1788
01:39:47,675 --> 01:39:49,467
Hey, ready?
Yeah!

1789
01:39:56,050 --> 01:39:57,592
Get on.

1790
01:40:00,842 --> 01:40:01,924
Yeah!

1791
01:40:01,925 --> 01:40:04,466
Okay, guys, I'm coming!
Whoa!

1792
01:40:04,467 --> 01:40:05,842
Jesus!

1793
01:40:07,342 --> 01:40:09,008
I'm coming!

1794
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:19,008
Get up! Come on!
Okay.

1795
01:40:20,425 --> 01:40:21,674
You got me.

1796
01:40:21,675 --> 01:40:23,883
Those things are
really dangerous!

1797
01:40:25,592 --> 01:40:27,342
- Come on!
- Go!

1798
01:40:29,592 --> 01:40:31,800
Get him in! Move it!

1799
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:37,924
What is happening?

1800
01:40:37,925 --> 01:40:40,341
Where are they?

1801
01:40:40,342 --> 01:40:42,383
They should be
arriving any second.

1802
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:46,008
That is, if they're gonna
get here by midnight.

1803
01:40:58,342 --> 01:41:00,008
Okay, feeling fear.

1804
01:41:00,925 --> 01:41:02,049
Fear.

1805
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:03,342
Anger, anger.

1806
01:41:04,425 --> 01:41:05,757
Full house!

1807
01:41:05,758 --> 01:41:07,508
That's enough.

1808
01:41:08,925 --> 01:41:10,508
I was done.

1809
01:41:11,383 --> 01:41:15,507
So nice to see you all again.

1810
01:41:15,508 --> 01:41:18,632
But since we're
such old friends,

1811
01:41:18,633 --> 01:41:21,008
let's skip the formalities.

1812
01:41:21,925 --> 01:41:23,549
One of you

1813
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:26,800
has something we require.

1814
01:41:28,467 --> 01:41:30,008
So give it over.

1815
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:40,633
Nothing at all?

1816
01:41:41,758 --> 01:41:42,842
Really?

1817
01:41:45,967 --> 01:41:47,925
Sit down!

1818
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:56,008
Let's go, let's go!

1819
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:01,341
Hurry up and move them quickly
before they can do anything.

1820
01:42:01,342 --> 01:42:02,592
Get those lights off me!

1821
01:42:08,342 --> 01:42:09,842
Get on the plane!

1822
01:42:11,842 --> 01:42:14,008
Hey!

1823
01:42:16,633 --> 01:42:17,675
Get on the plane!

1824
01:42:27,342 --> 01:42:28,632
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, hey!

1825
01:42:28,633 --> 01:42:30,633
Yeah, take off immediately.

1826
01:42:33,842 --> 01:42:36,632
You know, you make it
almost too easy?

1827
01:42:36,633 --> 01:42:38,507
I mean,
even your hilarious attempts

1828
01:42:38,508 --> 01:42:40,424
to make
yourselves unpredictable,

1829
01:42:40,425 --> 01:42:42,382
just follow the same
pattern each time.

1830
01:42:42,383 --> 01:42:44,424
Set up, set up, set up.

1831
01:42:44,425 --> 01:42:48,299
Which tonight was going
to be stroke of midnight,

1832
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:50,883
middle of the Thames?
Tell me if I'm warm.

1833
01:42:55,717 --> 01:42:59,633
Well, there will be a big
reveal, and it will come now.

1834
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:03,758
The stick, dear boy.

1835
01:43:04,925 --> 01:43:06,342
- No.
- Fine.

1836
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,007
Start with her.

1837
01:43:09,008 --> 01:43:11,508
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!

1838
01:43:13,633 --> 01:43:17,007
Give it to him.
Danny, give him the card.

1839
01:43:17,008 --> 01:43:18,883
- Just give it to him.
- Danny, come on.

1840
01:43:28,883 --> 01:43:30,008
We'll have a closer look.

1841
01:43:38,592 --> 01:43:40,632
Okay, I owe you an apology.

1842
01:43:40,633 --> 01:43:42,466
Leader, you should have
planned an escape, okay?

1843
01:43:42,467 --> 01:43:44,632
This is the both of us.
Okay, it's the both of us.

1844
01:43:44,633 --> 01:43:46,299
Guys, come on!
Come on, stop!

1845
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,007
You, to save your
little girlfriend!

1846
01:43:48,008 --> 01:43:50,007
To save my... He had
a knife to her head!

1847
01:43:50,008 --> 01:43:51,507
I'm a Horseman, you dick!

1848
01:43:51,508 --> 01:43:52,799
All right, you know what?
This is not the time!

1849
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,382
And you, what's your deal, man?

1850
01:43:54,383 --> 01:43:55,632
Look, they're not
gonna get blood

1851
01:43:55,633 --> 01:43:57,966
They're probably gonna
throw us out of the plane.

1852
01:43:57,967 --> 01:43:59,674
Really?
I'm sorry to interrupt,

1853
01:43:59,675 --> 01:44:01,841
but I just have to
say congratulations.

1854
01:44:01,842 --> 01:44:03,050
And thank you!

1855
01:44:04,675 --> 01:44:05,882
It's real.

1856
01:44:05,883 --> 01:44:07,507
What?

1857
01:44:07,508 --> 01:44:08,967
It's real?

1858
01:44:10,675 --> 01:44:11,757
Bring them through.

1859
01:44:11,758 --> 01:44:12,924
Did you say it's real?

1860
01:44:12,925 --> 01:44:13,966
What is he talking about?

1861
01:44:13,967 --> 01:44:15,382
Move!

1862
01:44:15,383 --> 01:44:16,842
Well done, my boy.

1863
01:44:20,717 --> 01:44:23,341
Cote Du Marisule champagne.

1864
01:44:23,342 --> 01:44:25,966
It's the most expensive bottle

1865
01:44:25,967 --> 01:44:27,467
on Earth.

1866
01:44:28,342 --> 01:44:30,507
$1.2 million.

1867
01:44:30,508 --> 01:44:34,549
And I saved it just
for this occasion.

1868
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:38,383
Honestly, same bottle,
Liquor Shack, 700K.

1869
01:44:38,842 --> 01:44:40,632
Hey.

1870
01:44:40,633 --> 01:44:41,966
You got what you wanted.

1871
01:44:41,967 --> 01:44:44,674
So, does this mean
you're letting us go?

1872
01:44:44,675 --> 01:44:47,674
Knowing what you
know about us? No.

1873
01:44:47,675 --> 01:44:48,841
You sure?

1874
01:44:48,842 --> 01:44:50,842
Chase, what shall we do?

1875
01:44:53,008 --> 01:44:55,382
Toss them out.

1876
01:44:55,383 --> 01:44:57,633
Get your last words
in quickly, everybody!

1877
01:44:59,842 --> 01:45:01,841
No! Come on! No!

1878
01:45:01,842 --> 01:45:02,883
Farewell.

1879
01:45:03,675 --> 01:45:05,883
God! No!

1880
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:09,591
Wait! I just wanna say.

1881
01:45:09,592 --> 01:45:11,841
I came into the world
with the wrong family,

1882
01:45:11,842 --> 01:45:13,924
but I'm leaving
with the right one.

1883
01:45:13,925 --> 01:45:15,632
I love you guys!

1884
01:45:15,633 --> 01:45:16,717
No!
No, no, no!

1885
01:45:18,508 --> 01:45:20,924
This is how I kicked
you out of the womb.

1886
01:45:20,925 --> 01:45:22,050
No!

1887
01:45:23,633 --> 01:45:24,925
Who's next?

1888
01:45:31,008 --> 01:45:32,966
No, wait! Let me go!

1889
01:45:32,967 --> 01:45:35,466
Let go of me!

1890
01:45:35,467 --> 01:45:36,883
No, no, no!

1891
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:39,342
Let me go!
Toss her!

1892
01:45:43,633 --> 01:45:44,882
God!

1893
01:45:44,883 --> 01:45:46,341
Hurry up and shut that door!

1894
01:45:46,342 --> 01:45:47,966
It's getting cold in here.

1895
01:45:47,967 --> 01:45:49,967
Okay, hit the road, Jack!

1896
01:45:55,508 --> 01:45:56,675
No, no, no!

1897
01:45:57,967 --> 01:46:00,425
A lot of brain,
but not enough brawn.

1898
01:46:04,008 --> 01:46:05,050
That was fun!

1899
01:46:07,883 --> 01:46:09,549
Cheers!

1900
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:10,967
Well done, my boy.

1901
01:46:15,508 --> 01:46:16,841
Um...

1902
01:46:16,842 --> 01:46:19,049
No, is it supposed
to taste like that?

1903
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:20,717
No, it is not.

1904
01:46:40,508 --> 01:46:42,008
What the hell is going on?

1905
01:46:51,967 --> 01:46:53,675
Okay, come pick them up!

1906
01:46:54,842 --> 01:46:56,675
- Come on.
- Come on out.

1907
01:47:09,925 --> 01:47:11,632
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1908
01:47:11,633 --> 01:47:13,842
<i>The Horsemen!</i>

1909
01:47:34,008 --> 01:47:36,507
<i>No, you should feel pretty
good about yourself, man.</i>

1910
01:47:36,508 --> 01:47:37,799
<i>You predicted it correctly.</i>

1911
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,049
<i>The Thames, stroke of midnight.</i>

1912
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:41,967
<i>New Year's Eve.
Happy New Year!</i>

1913
01:47:48,925 --> 01:47:51,674
We are moving now.
The whole thing just changed.

1914
01:47:51,675 --> 01:47:54,508
All backup into position stat!
We're on the move.

1915
01:47:55,842 --> 01:47:56,966
You're staying here!

1916
01:47:56,967 --> 01:47:58,008
Of course.

1917
01:48:05,425 --> 01:48:07,466
Move! Move!
Out of the way!

1918
01:48:07,467 --> 01:48:09,674
<i>Wow!
Thank you very much, London!</i>

1919
01:48:09,675 --> 01:48:12,591
<i>We would like to acknowledge
not just our old friend</i>

1920
01:48:12,592 --> 01:48:16,674
<i>But his young and very
brilliant son, Walter Mabry.</i>

1921
01:48:16,675 --> 01:48:19,341
<i>Who has performed one of the
greatest feats of illusion</i>

1922
01:48:19,342 --> 01:48:20,882
<i>even we have ever seen.</i>

1923
01:48:20,883 --> 01:48:25,299
<i>He has, amazingly, brought
himself back from the dead!</i>

1924
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:27,882
<i>But before he did that,</i>

1925
01:48:27,883 --> 01:48:29,424
<i>he revealed someone.</i>

1926
01:48:29,425 --> 01:48:32,341
<i>And we think it
only right to give him</i>

1927
01:48:32,342 --> 01:48:34,591
<i>a proper introduction.</i>

1928
01:48:34,592 --> 01:48:37,466
<i>He is our friend
and he is our leader.</i>

1929
01:48:37,467 --> 01:48:38,674
<i>Dylan Shrike!</i>

1930
01:48:38,675 --> 01:48:40,675
<i>- Get over here!
- Yeah!</i>

1931
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:48,674
<i>So, normally</i>

1932
01:48:48,675 --> 01:48:53,507
<i>only the magician, his assistant,
and a few trusted stage hands</i>

1933
01:48:53,508 --> 01:48:55,674
<i>know the secret of a trick.</i>

1934
01:48:55,675 --> 01:48:58,757
<i>But tonight,
however, in this effect,</i>

1935
01:48:58,758 --> 01:49:01,882
<i>all of you people
around the Thames here.</i>

1936
01:49:01,883 --> 01:49:03,966
<i>And since we're streaming live,</i>

1937
01:49:03,967 --> 01:49:06,674
<i>everyone around the world</i>

1938
01:49:06,675 --> 01:49:09,341
<i>already knows everything.</i>

1939
01:49:09,342 --> 01:49:13,466
<i>And only these fellows here are
the ones left in the dark.</i>

1940
01:49:13,467 --> 01:49:16,466
<i>So let's see how closely
you were watching our shows.</i>

1941
01:49:16,467 --> 01:49:19,591
<i>Remember when we were
playing "Find the Lady."</i>

1942
01:49:19,592 --> 01:49:21,675
<i>I said that we
used a Barry Trap.</i>

1943
01:49:22,842 --> 01:49:26,591
<i>Some classic switches
and a few duplicates?</i>

1944
01:49:26,592 --> 01:49:30,050
<i>Well, that's how we switched
the driver of the truck.</i>

1945
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:35,466
<i>Which took us to
a duplicate hangar</i>

1946
01:49:35,467 --> 01:49:37,757
<i>where we used your need to rush,</i>

1947
01:49:37,758 --> 01:49:41,341
<i>and your fear of being seen
let you do the work for us.</i>

1948
01:49:41,342 --> 01:49:42,633
<i>Get those lights off me!</i>

1949
01:49:44,383 --> 01:49:46,466
<i>So, the airplane.</i>

1950
01:49:46,467 --> 01:49:48,050
<i>How did we get it to fly?</i>

1951
01:49:49,675 --> 01:49:51,674
<i>Well, we used fans,</i>

1952
01:49:51,675 --> 01:49:54,550
<i>and lights and rain machines.</i>

1953
01:49:59,675 --> 01:50:04,466
<i>Obviously, all of this was
reliant on us getting caught.</i>

1954
01:50:04,467 --> 01:50:07,882
<i>That you would do exactly
what we needed you to do</i>

1955
01:50:07,883 --> 01:50:09,507
<i>once you did catch us.</i>

1956
01:50:09,508 --> 01:50:11,382
<i>My brother Chase,</i>

1957
01:50:11,383 --> 01:50:15,674
<i>who was technical adviser
to the losing team.</i>

1958
01:50:15,675 --> 01:50:18,466
<i>He taught us that it's
all about blind spots.</i>

1959
01:50:18,467 --> 01:50:20,007
I know where you're going!

1960
01:50:20,008 --> 01:50:23,717
<i>And, surprises.</i>

1961
01:50:25,508 --> 01:50:26,966
Watch it, hobo.

1962
01:50:26,967 --> 01:50:28,716
Why don't you watch
the watch I'm wearing,

1963
01:50:28,717 --> 01:50:31,591
the where of where
you're watching, and sleep!

1964
01:50:31,592 --> 01:50:33,632
It's going to be your idea
to throw the Horsemen

1965
01:50:33,633 --> 01:50:34,966
out of the plane.

1966
01:50:34,967 --> 01:50:37,299
If all of this is
kind of confusing to you,

1967
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:39,591
I can maybe catch
you up on it later.

1968
01:50:39,592 --> 01:50:42,008
Probably see you what,
three to five?

1969
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:45,299
Come on, put it there.

1970
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:46,758
Hey! Tit for tat, bro!

1971
01:50:48,008 --> 01:50:51,007
<i>Basically,
we showed them everything.</i>

1972
01:50:51,008 --> 01:50:56,508
<i>To steal the very thing that
is in your pocket right now.</i>

1973
01:50:58,550 --> 01:50:59,883
<i>Whoops!</i>

1974
01:51:03,592 --> 01:51:06,049
<i>You know, this thing here,</i>

1975
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:09,424
<i>which you said you could
use to adjust markets,</i>

1976
01:51:09,425 --> 01:51:11,007
<i>manipulate governments,</i>

1977
01:51:11,008 --> 01:51:17,967
<i>Also, you could, as you said control
the public from outside the grid.</i>

1978
01:51:19,508 --> 01:51:24,799
<i>These men destroy
people's lives.</i>

1979
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:28,841
<i>Spying on the world, robbing
you of your right to privacy.</i>

1980
01:51:28,842 --> 01:51:32,341
<i>And they do that
by hiding in the dark.</i>

1981
01:51:32,342 --> 01:51:36,841
<i>So, in the Horsemen tradition,
we're here to expose them.</i>

1982
01:51:36,842 --> 01:51:38,800
<i>Tonight, they,</i>

1983
01:51:39,675 --> 01:51:41,966
<i>like all of us,</i>

1984
01:51:41,967 --> 01:51:44,842
<i>are finally stepping
into the light.</i>

1985
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:52,633
<i>We are the Horsemen
and we will be back very soon!</i>

1986
01:51:55,342 --> 01:51:57,716
Five, four, three,

1987
01:51:57,717 --> 01:51:59,425
two, one!

1988
01:52:16,008 --> 01:52:18,758
Hey, we're on the clock.
Get a move on.

1989
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:25,049
There's more inside.
Don't you bloody touch me!

1990
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:26,842
The Horsemen are over on the...

1991
01:52:29,633 --> 01:52:31,050
Shit!

1992
01:52:31,717 --> 01:52:33,632
Stay with them!

1993
01:52:33,633 --> 01:52:35,674
Everybody spread out!

1994
01:52:35,675 --> 01:52:37,633
Nobody leaves this barge!

1995
01:52:39,508 --> 01:52:42,633
Rhodes, hold it right there!
Do not move!

1996
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:49,882
This contains everything.

1997
01:52:49,883 --> 01:52:53,007
Not just Walter and Tressler,
but all their dealings.

1998
01:52:53,008 --> 01:52:56,049
All their contacts,
the entire network.

1999
01:52:56,050 --> 01:52:58,466
And why on Earth
would I believe you?

2000
01:52:58,467 --> 01:53:00,299
I told you.

2001
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:02,299
I'm the same man
I've always been.

2002
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,716
Move it! Come on!
Let's go, go, go!

2003
01:53:04,717 --> 01:53:07,549
I'm not part of this
organization! I'm Merritt.

2004
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:09,842
I'm a patsy!
I'm a patsy!

2005
01:53:11,717 --> 01:53:12,967
10 minutes.

2006
01:53:15,467 --> 01:53:17,592
Now you're playing
the long game.

2007
01:53:31,425 --> 01:53:33,674
Dad, I promise
you I will fix this.

2008
01:53:33,675 --> 01:53:36,007
You can't.
Stop calling me dad.

2009
01:53:36,008 --> 01:53:40,049
There were so many women, I have
no idea whose bastard you are.

2010
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:43,716
What happened? Thin air, gone.
Come with me.

2011
01:53:43,717 --> 01:53:45,549
What're you talking about, gone?

2012
01:53:45,550 --> 01:53:47,507
People don't just disappear.

2013
01:53:47,508 --> 01:53:50,342
You realize that he doesn't
actually have magical powers!

2014
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:31,382
Hey, guys.
Hey!

2015
01:54:31,383 --> 01:54:33,758
Good to see you all.
Good to see you, Li.

2016
01:54:34,842 --> 01:54:36,008
Come on in.

2017
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:40,633
Good morning.

2018
01:54:40,967 --> 01:54:42,050
Welcome.

2019
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:46,466
I'm proud of you.

2020
01:54:46,467 --> 01:54:48,007
All of you.

2021
01:54:48,008 --> 01:54:50,507
I have a lot to show you.

2022
01:54:50,508 --> 01:54:51,717
Come.

2023
01:54:52,842 --> 01:54:54,050
Come.

2024
01:55:05,508 --> 01:55:06,717
Dad.

2025
01:55:24,008 --> 01:55:25,757
Yes.

2026
01:55:25,758 --> 01:55:28,632
Your father and I were partners.

2027
01:55:28,633 --> 01:55:31,800
Our act was that of rivals.

2028
01:55:32,883 --> 01:55:35,841
I was the
hard-eyed realist.

2029
01:55:35,842 --> 01:55:38,674
He was the
dreamy-eyed idealist.

2030
01:55:38,675 --> 01:55:41,508
We thought it was
the perfect misdirect.

2031
01:55:42,508 --> 01:55:46,341
Yes, in public, I did goad him.

2032
01:55:46,342 --> 01:55:48,300
The only thing
we didn't count on

2033
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:50,925
was it going so wrong.

2034
01:55:54,967 --> 01:55:56,841
Why?

2035
01:55:56,842 --> 01:55:58,757
Why didn't you ever
say anything to me?

2036
01:55:58,758 --> 01:56:00,425
I don't know.

2037
01:56:01,467 --> 01:56:02,799
Give it a name.

2038
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,841
Shame, guilt.

2039
01:56:04,842 --> 01:56:06,342
Regret.

2040
01:56:09,925 --> 01:56:12,925
Hey, guys, you might wanna
come take a look at this.

2041
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:18,507
Look.

2042
01:56:18,508 --> 01:56:20,341
<i>I put you in jail, man.</i>

2043
01:56:20,342 --> 01:56:22,716
Why didn't you
say something then?

2044
01:56:22,717 --> 01:56:25,841
Well, you know, I was going to.

2045
01:56:25,842 --> 01:56:29,842
But then, you were so quick to show
your personal motivations that...

2046
01:56:31,717 --> 01:56:33,507
Well, quite frankly

2047
01:56:33,508 --> 01:56:35,299
it spoiled the trick for me.

2048
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:36,632
I showed my weakness.

2049
01:56:36,633 --> 01:56:39,507
Well, it showed
you weren't ready.

2050
01:56:39,508 --> 01:56:42,299
But when you came
back to my cell,

2051
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:46,342
you had let go of your
30-year vendetta against me

2052
01:56:47,592 --> 01:56:48,967
for your Horsemen.

2053
01:56:50,633 --> 01:56:53,341
<i>And I said to myself,</i>

2054
01:56:53,342 --> 01:56:55,425
<i>"That's Lionel's boy."</i>

2055
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:58,674
<i>And I knew it was my job</i>

2056
01:56:58,675 --> 01:57:03,507
<i>to see to it that he became the
magician he was born to be.</i>

2057
01:57:03,508 --> 01:57:05,842
All that was left then was...

2058
01:57:07,633 --> 01:57:08,883
For me to hit bottom.

2059
01:57:09,675 --> 01:57:10,966
So the safe,

2060
01:57:10,967 --> 01:57:12,924
my father's wristwatch,

2061
01:57:12,925 --> 01:57:14,592
that was all you?

2062
01:57:17,342 --> 01:57:20,674
<i>Walter and Tressler,
were they in on it too?</i>

2063
01:57:20,675 --> 01:57:23,632
<i>We knew Walter was in hiding.</i>

2064
01:57:23,633 --> 01:57:27,467
<i>The Octa show was a setup
to expose him to the public.</i>

2065
01:57:30,633 --> 01:57:32,757
<i>And you were right
about the Horsemen.</i>

2066
01:57:32,758 --> 01:57:37,675
<i>They needed to learn to work
together like a single organism.</i>

2067
01:57:45,383 --> 01:57:47,966
Now I know why
you look so familiar.

2068
01:57:47,967 --> 01:57:49,550
You're the Horsemen, aren't you?

2069
01:57:57,342 --> 01:58:00,966
<i>But that can't be
what all this is about.</i>

2070
01:58:00,967 --> 01:58:02,966
You know, the best tricks

2071
01:58:02,967 --> 01:58:05,507
work on many levels.

2072
01:58:05,508 --> 01:58:07,424
And the deepest one,

2073
01:58:07,425 --> 01:58:09,549
for me, at least,

2074
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:12,425
is this moment right here.

2075
01:58:15,842 --> 01:58:17,508
I'm sorry, Dylan.

2076
01:58:18,008 --> 01:58:20,674
I miss your father.

2077
01:58:20,675 --> 01:58:24,382
30 years is a long time to drag
something around, isn't it?

2078
01:58:24,383 --> 01:58:25,967
Yes, it is.

2079
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:37,342
So, now what?

2080
01:58:39,633 --> 01:58:42,591
Now I'm about out of moves...

2081
01:58:42,592 --> 01:58:46,424
Come on, you're the one who said
that you believe that this road

2082
01:58:46,425 --> 01:58:48,341
lead to the great wizard
behind the curtain.

2083
01:58:48,342 --> 01:58:52,592
And that you'd finally
get to look him in the eyes.

2084
01:58:53,008 --> 01:58:54,758
I am.

2085
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:03,007
It's your game now.

2086
01:59:03,008 --> 01:59:05,758
You play it however you see fit.

2087
01:59:06,883 --> 01:59:09,341
My suggestion, however,

2088
01:59:09,342 --> 01:59:12,841
is that you find
yourself a successor.

2089
01:59:12,842 --> 01:59:14,799
Hi. Okay, so, um...

2090
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,966
Well, obviously,
we have a few questions.

2091
01:59:16,967 --> 01:59:18,924
Right?

2092
01:59:18,925 --> 01:59:20,757
By "a few," I think he
means, like, five million.

2093
01:59:20,758 --> 01:59:22,466
Yeah.
Well.

2094
01:59:22,467 --> 01:59:24,382
Good luck to you all.

2095
01:59:24,383 --> 01:59:25,966
What! Okay. See,
that's not fair.

2096
01:59:25,967 --> 01:59:27,299
Come on.
That's not right.

2097
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:28,549
That's gonna make
me really angry!

2098
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:29,799
Not right now.

2099
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,550
Um, by the way...

2100
01:59:33,675 --> 01:59:36,342
Pay no attention to the curtain.

2101
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,507
There is a curtain.

2102
01:59:40,508 --> 01:59:41,883
Go, go, go.

2103
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:53,841
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

2104
01:59:53,842 --> 01:59:55,757
<i>But is it truth?</i>

2105
01:59:55,758 --> 01:59:58,507
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

2106
01:59:58,508 --> 02:00:01,007
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

2107
02:00:01,008 --> 02:00:03,049
<i>When you emerge,</i>

2108
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:05,507
<i>and you will,</i>

2109
02:00:05,508 --> 02:00:08,674
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

2110
02:00:08,675 --> 02:00:11,382
<i>Because mark my words,</i>

2111
02:00:11,383 --> 02:00:14,424
<i>you will get
what's coming to you</i>

2112
02:00:14,425 --> 02:00:17,008
<i>in ways you can't expect.</i>

2113
02:00:17,842 --> 02:00:20,632
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

2114
02:00:20,633 --> 02:00:23,841
<i>Because one thing I believe in</i>

2115
02:00:23,842 --> 02:00:25,882
<i>is an eye</i>

2116
02:00:25,883 --> 02:00:27,800
<i>for an eye.</i>
